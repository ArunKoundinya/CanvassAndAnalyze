    "text": "Continuing from the previous blog\n\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureGlossary101/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureGlossary102/\n\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nBefore we move our identity from ATMAN to BRAHMAN, it is necessary to establish identity with ATMAN. As leading thyself comes before leading others.\nWe left the previous blog with this question:\nBut how can we move our identity to BRAHMAN? Are there any Universal rules or guiding principles?\n\n\n\n\n\nYes, there are Universal rules called “eternal laws” termed as Sanātana Dharma. \nIf we observe, the “Sun” is one the most prominent source of our life. How can Sun provide so much energy for generations after generations? \nOn a spiritual dimension, Sun is a perfect live example of “eternal laws” in action. ( Link to an earlier series blog - Our Relatable Personal God )\n\nSun generates the energy within\nIt gives power but doesn’t take it back.\nIt shows up every day with the same intensity.\nIt plays a prominent role in all the seasons to occur.\nIt holds together the planets of the solar system with its gravitational pull.\nIt doesn’t tell how to radiate. But powers light to reflect thyself.\n\nAll the above sentences summarize - being in “Service” and “Awareness”. This is all about Sanātana Dharma.\nAlternatively, if we try to link Suns’ way of life to us, it translates as follows:\n\nConstant Self Inquiry leads us to a state of “Consciousness,” i.e., being with our showman. Wherein we get enlightened about ourselves.\nOnce we are enlightened, it is about giving back knowledge to the seekers through self-inquiry.\nResults don’t matter when being in “Service”. It is about being dutiful to one’s prescribed duty.\n\n Above three looks familiar in our journey of the previous series of blogs. { Summarised in this version of the blog - Link }\nSanātana Dharma is about the way of living and is not related to any religion, which is the crux of Indian culture.\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nP.S.: Scientifically, Sun radiates its energy by nuclear fusion. It means it has to lose itself, i.e., mass, to release energy. The most exciting fact is that by the time the Sun becomes a white dwarf, it would only reduce 1% of the Sun’s mass. Thus, just 1% of the Sun’s mass generates energy for 4 billion years.\nThink about being in “Self-Inquiry” for our lifetim!!!!"

Recall your first day of symptom (not first day tested +ve). This is the vital “Day 1”.\nPhase 1) Day 1 to 5: virus + immune system war\n\nSymptoms: low grade fever, body ache, mild cough or none at all\nDon’t give medication (antibiotic does not aid virus battle; steroid will suppress immunity and prolong viral infection)\nOptional health supplement\n80% of people will recover by now. 20% of people take a dangerous turn…\n\nPhase 2) Day 6 to 10: immune system attacks blood vessels in the lungs; leading to blood clot (no longer virus battle)\n\nSymptoms: deep hacking dry cough, rising/returning fever. Note: this is not pneumonia (yet). Warning: Don’t wait for home-digital sensor to register a drop in oxygen saturation. Don’t wait until breathless. Go hospital early.\nAdminister steroid (5 days) and anti-coagulant (3 weeks) under medical watch. Address cytokine shower to prevent cytokine storm (will need ventilator by then).\nMost patient will feel remarkably better when steroid is started, and will go on to recover.\nHowever by day 5, fever and breathlessness may return in elderly, diabetic or weakened patients who enter into Phase 3….\n\nPhase 3) After 5 days on steroid, suppressed immunity develop into bacteria infection. This is now pneumonia. \n\nAdminister antibiotics and pneumonia medications\n\nThe most important takeaway from this video is that - Steroids would invite opportunistic infections which are already present in our body system; And whose immune system is compromised would take a more dangerous turn. So, Abusing Steroids will abuse our own health system or even life if it not administered under the supervision of a registered practitioner.\nAlso, Abusing Antibiotic usage as well would lead bacteria inside our body to become Antibiotic resistance.\n\n\nImmuno Suppressants Drugs - Quick Re-Cap ?\nSteroids which belong to the family of Immuno Suppressant Drugs has been prevalent over 50 years in the human history and have proved to be a life saving drugs for various risky auto-immune situations { Like Multiple Sclerosis, Psoriasis, Type 1 Diabetes, Rheumatoid Arthritis etc.; }\n\n\n\n\n\nPrimary role of the Immuno Suppresant Drugs is to target the Hyper Active components of the immune system and avoid damage of our own cells thus saving US.\nAlso, these drugs are as well used to in cadavers to keep organs alive which is useful for organ transplantation. Also, the same drug is given to the person who needs this organ.\n\n\nWhat is MucorMycosis? Why it is been trending now  ?\nMucormycetes, the group of fungi that cause mucormycosis, are present throughout the environment,. Mucormycosis is a very rare infection. It is caused by exposure to mucor mould which is commonly found in soil, plants, manure, and decaying fruits and vegetables. The fungi are often also found in indoor and outdoor air, in food stuffs, and in dust.\nA Condition of MucorMycosis appears in different parts of the body depending upon the predisposing condition.\n\n\n\n\n\nMost of the cases that are registered in India seemed to be of Rhino-Cerebral; So, the doctors assumed that it is because either because of early usage of Steroids or Steroid Abuse. \nSo accordingly, Doctors believe Mucormycosis, which has an overall mortality rate of 50%, may be being triggered by the use of steroids. \n\n\nWhat does happens when it enters our body. Is it so deadly  ?\nIn Majority of the cases it is assumed to have entered from air through our nose.  Patients suffering from this fungal infection typically have symptoms:\n\nstuffy and bleeding nose\nswelling of and pain in the eye\ndrooping of eyelids; and \nblurred and finally, loss of vision. \nThere could be black patches of skin around the nose.\n\nIt is considered to be a deadly disease because if we defect/react to these symptoms late; It might lead to removal of organs like jaws or eyes; If further delay might damage brain cells leading to death.\nHowever, the most bright fact is that it will not be dangerous for majority of the healthy people and normal people; It will effect the people whose immune systems has been severely compromised.\n\n\nWhat are the  most important reasons for this spike now ?\nAs mentioned and discussed above, the prime understanding among the doctors based on the earlier data is that the abusive usage of corticosteroids will lead to this Fungal infection. Since, most of the people are having home treatment for COVID under no medico supervision there would be case of early usage or repetitive usage of them leading to a compromised immune system in our body. Since, the cases of COVID has surged due to new strain it is logical to assume for the same.\nHowever, there are specific theories who also assume that the usage of steroids or abusive usage has happened in the past; But not have seen so many Fungal Infection Cases. { Also, we know from one of our earlier blogs that people who die in India with underlying reasons of Diabetics are approx. 2000 per day }\nA recent study by kerala doctor suggests the following three reasons; { As per the study of 200 people 15% did not used steroids }\n\nThe first line of defence for Mucor is Nose. When we inhale steam excessively there is high possibility of damaging epithelial cells;  Which is like a free entry for any bacteria or fungus into our body directly.\n100% of the people has used Antibiotics like Azithromycin, Doxycycline which made the existing bacteria and fungal becoming resistant and got an opportunity to infect our body after few days when our immune system is compromised.\nUsually, fungus thrive in zinc rich environments; Unnoticed and heavy administration of zinc supplements would also invite the fungus to grow inside our body.\nA Combination of all of these things would also, lead to the severity of the case.\n\n\n\nConclusions:\n\nThe Thumb rule remains the same; The patient cannot be a registered doctor and prescribe himself by browsing on internet. The drugs has to be administered as per dosage levels, interval levels and for a specific duration from the onset of the disease.\nIt is important to note that this fungus is available on soil spores as well; When cow eats grass from the soil spores; This fungus gets into their digestive system and then finds its outward via manure; So, administrating or handling excess of this or when using steroids will be like a welcome bell.\nIt is as well recommended to be in hygienic environment when you are under administration of steroids.\nFinally, Steam as we learnt above has to be avoided in excess; However, for many of them might not damage the epithelial cells; But certainly dehydrate the body to a large extent if done for longer times in a day. \nRequest to have lesser dependence on Whatsapp Forwards and depend on experienced doctor.\nAlso, a massive study is being conducted by Israel Scientists on Steroids for our future safety."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Note: This is not related to Value & Belief System\nFew popular beliefs that we have in India are - ” South Indians can’t articulate much “,” By the age of 28 we have to get settled in life “,” The way they dress-up dictates their inner confidence ” , ” If a women boozes it is not right “,” Seeing is Believing ” and etc.;\nBeliefs are Tenets that help us to navigate the complex world for our comfort. As Brain is an energy expense organ it looks for short cuts to arrive at these beliefs based on our experience, information we processed and what we see.\nIf a person is having a belief that his belief system. If two people has the same belief it becomes a shared belief. If say entire community has that belief that it becomes a larger unquestionable belief. If say the entire community has that belief for a generation or a decade then most probably it becomes an axiom. \nThe formation of these axioms has the same principles across organizations, homes and society. Most interesting aspect is that the formation of shared beliefs are stronger at younger age. The belief of person is authority has a larger influence on the downward hierarchy for the formation of belief system (For example, children are strongly predisposed to believe their parents, and, as adults, we are inclined to believe authorities. Try experimenting to stepping down from authority - you will see that at times the same beliefs would not become shared and penetrated. )\nNow when there is an axiom; why to worry about the truth???\nThe Triumph of Truth gives a lasting pleasure than to be in the existing beliefs; Which of course helps us to learn from our mistakes and ignorances;\nOne such life story which i still remember to date is about the life story of Galileo Galilei who has faced all the odds and at the cost of personal ruin to tell about the truth to the world.\nTo Conclude, \n\nMost Important hurdle in human life is to challenge their own inner core belief system. Once, we get convinced rest should be a piece of cake.\n\n“Hesitating to act because the whole vision might not be achieved, or because others do not yet share it, is an attitude that only hinders progress.” - M K Gandhi Ji."

    "text": "Continuing from previous blogs:\nWe have observed where the Rishi who gets enlightened through self inquiry with a true inherent desire to meet the Showman; they would come forward to share the similar experience to his few selected disciples and thus ‘the Rishi’ becomes ‘the Guru’.  Whom have created a way for each and everyone of us (In terms of Personal God) to get us liberated and realize the Showman within ourselves. And then we learnt that people who embark a travel to meet the showman are termed as ‘Brahmacharya’; To get motivated to meet the showman they start to pray the Sun who is more visible and tangible; and then continue their path for the ultimate showman.\nRishis Disciple is now in a confusion mode asking about the inner light dualities among the people and again got into confusion when he envisaged that his realization to showman has to be Sacrificed to realize him. \nWe left the previous blog where Shishya shouts and asks..\n” Then why do we give naivedyam ( नैवेद्यम, నైవేద్యం) to our personal god and do pooja; when Sacrificing is a tool for realizing him?”\nAnd then Rishi/Guru responds in this way:\n” Say, you are not feeling well today; A doctor has came to your home and helped you. How do you thank him ? ”\n” It is simple Guruji , we give our offerings like money or related things like fruits or grains ”\n” Then, how do you thank to your showman, who has given you this life? ”\n” Guruji, are you referring that providing naivedyam is a way to thank him ”\nGuruji smiled and bent down near the river flow and took some water with his both hands and dranked it and continued, ” Showman has provided us this water without which we cannot live; do you think that providing him the same is a way to thank him ? Like, you cannot give the medicines that doctor has given for your consumption, isn’t it so ? ”\n” Assume that i have a skill; which you don’t have at this point of time; and you have an ardent desire to gain that skill. What would you do ? ”\n” Since, you are my Guru. I will try to do what you like and how you think a Shishya has to be. Such that you would get impress in my behavior and provide your Vidya to me ”\n” Then, if you want to realize showman; and also having learnt that your realization towards Showman has to be sacrificed; what would you do ? ”\nWith a lot of eagerness under his throat, ” Guruji, we will ask the people who has already realized the showman. And behave like the ones whom showman likes us and finally we get liberated realizing him ”\n” If you find no one; what would you do ? ”\n” Guruji, I’m unable to think. This is beyond my understanding. Please tell me how is it possible !! ”\nGuruji smiled and said, ” We need to just ask him. As he is the source ”\nand continued , ” When someone is bound to get the answers directly from the source; that someone showers or expresses his thanks to showman in various ways i.e.; by Pooja, Praising Him and being with him; So, that is called Pooja with ardent devotion and not the pooja that you do everyday in the morning for some time; which is just a morning ritual. ”\nShishya looks so fresh and completely engrossed on those thoughts; meanwhile Guruji drank stomach full of water and walks back.\nMeanwhile Shishya gets awakened and comes running towards Guruji and asks ” If Prayer is a ritual why it has been made as a ritual for us? ”\n – Answer in next blog\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nBhagvadgita: Chapter 3 ; 13th Sloka\nThe Good People who eat what is left from the sacrifice are released from all sins but those wicked people who prepare food for their own sake - verily they eat sin.\nIs some one takes it literally; we provide Naivedyam to god everyday as a Sacrifice.\nMy previous blogs for reference -  \n\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/learnings-indian-culture/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning101/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning102/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning103/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning104/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning105/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning106/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning107/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning108/"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Note: My Opine on suicidal related news w.r.t. Indian Sub-Continent; Nonetheless can be projected for Pan World!!!\nIn my previous blogs’ {COVID 19: DEATHS , LOCK DOWN & RECESSION} Fig:1 we have reviewed about top reasons of deaths for India. The one that moved my mind & heart is about the “Suicides” between the age group 15 & 34. To quote an interesting and emotive statistic is that ’’Suicide” is the top reason for the deaths for that age group.\nIrony is that Psychiatry, Psychology, Psychotherapy etc.; has not yet observed any booming upsurge either in pedagogy or from the doctoral takers in India. {Note: AIDS has created a niche market for Sexual Specialists} It may be market or inherent bias or ‘Psychology isn’t so tough to understand’; usually people try to limit themselves for a self therapy or a community therapy. Former isn’t helpful at all and latter provide a great relief. On a Hindsight, we should never forget that there is no substitute for an expert advice if we are in a listening mode.\nBefore reading further; I request to read my earlier blog on  Fear & Stress  where I tried to link both of these concepts with a cute love story; hope you will enjoy reading that blog again. Also, request to read an quick summary/abstract of research article done by Researchers on Stress & Suicide in Adolescents \nLet us now explore the Indian Sub-Continent Suicidal data and its reasons. The growth of suicides is on increasing trend with 2% Y-on-Y while that of our population growth is 1% annually.\nQuick Highlights from Fig1 & Fig2:\n\nSuicidal Male/Female ratio is 20% higher than that of the population Male/Female ratio.\nEducational/Peer/Career Pressure has been growing YonY at 2 to 3%\nMarriage & Love Affairs growing at 4 to 5% { and on higher side for Females } - Still in 20th century Dowry related issues remains among the top reasons for Females \nOther Family Problems at 2 to 3%\nPoverty Deaths is almost at constant rate of that population.\nDrug Abuse/ Addiction is growing at 13%.\nNote: The Emerging Cause of “Cyber-Bullying & Suicide” documentation seems not perfect yet.\n\nAs per WHO, the ratio of Suicidal Attempts : Actual Suicides for this age group is 20:1. Which translates to 8000 suicidal attempts per day for that age group in India. {A suicide attempt is an attempt where a person tries to die by suicide but survives} {Also, the suicide attempts can lead to serious injuries to permanent disabilities}\n\n\n\nFig1: Suicide Causes for Age Group 15 to 30 Years in Indian Sub-Continent.\n\n\n\n\n\nFig2: Suicides/Day Trend Chart for Last 12 Years in Indian Sub-Continent {Age Group- 15 Years to 30 Years}\n\n\nFor every suicidal attempt there will be a train of negative thoughts that will happen in our mind that triggers the suicidal event which is usually termed as suicidal thoughts. The Ratio of Suicidal Thoughts: Suicidal Attempts is approximately considered as 5:1 which translates to over-all 40,000 suicidal thoughts per day for this age group alone. May be if we draw unique citizens of these 40K suicidal thoughts it may reduce to 25K; that is almost equal to that of Total Deaths/Day across all age groups in India.\nFew may be thinking as what might this be related to that of “COVID-19” situation. The Gravity of suicides committed in India and the required capacity of institutions which can prevent or offer therapy is equal to the medical need for India. Also, suicide can became a situation which can be correlated to the pandemic as well. Let us see some Social Isolation Suicidal causes across in the below table.\n\n\n\nFig3: Social Distancing Suicides across World; { Data still under compilation }\n\n\nThe additional factors that might trigger additional suicides during this Pandemic are “24X7 Anxiety News”, “Social Isolation”, “Economy Stress”, “Future UnEmployment”,“Uncertainty on Vaccine/Therapy” etc.; However, on a positive note as per the so-called pulling-together effect, whereby individuals undergoing a shared experience might support one another, thus strengthening social connectedness. Recent advancements in technology (eg, video conferencing) might facilitate pulling together. Epidemics and pandemics may also alter one’s views on health and mortality, making life more precious, death more fearsome, and suicide less likely.\nTo Conclude, as per the various studies done by experts the prime reason for suicide remains to be Fear. It happens to be that Fear triggers anxiety which in-turn triggers STRESS. Severe Stress and anxiety further leads to Depression; if aided with isolation may lead to Suicide.  Management of FEAR is utmost necessary to avoid stress and its related activities. UnderstandingOurFear & learning about it helps us to keep a “check on our health”. {Note: Fear is an underrated feeling which is the root cause of our survival as well as failures}\nUnderstanding the initial phases of physical signs of stress for either ourselves or our near ones and addressing with right care at right time helps the needy. { WHO Stress Management Tool Kit }\n\n\n\nFig4: Physical Signs of Stress\n\n\nFinal Commentary:\n\nHome Hacks to Reduce Stress: { Ministry of Health and Family Welfare  - Minding our Minds has shared this in relation to COVID-19 Stress Management; Request to go through as well}\n\nWhat To-Do & Not-To-Do during COVID-19:\n\nDo not Follow Sensational News\nDo not discuss the negative events with your friends but discuss the positive side of it.\nBe Busy. Have a hobby of yourself.\nKnowledge is power; the more you know about a certain issue, the less fearful you may feel. Make sure to access and believe only the most reliable sources of information for self-protection.\n\nQuick Mind Diversion Techniques:\n\nCall Distant Friends\nWrite a To-Do List for the week\nRead a book\nCook; Let us involve in Innovative Cooking\nLast but not the least - Take a Deep Breath\n\nHabitual Techniques for Long Term:\n\nExercise with breathing - Cardiac Exercises helps better. { Even Step-Up Exercises for 5 Minutes every day helps a lot }\nRegularize the Sleep Pattern.\nReduce Caffeine Intake.\nBalanced & Healthy Cooked Food\nHave a healthy company and Increase your Healthy network which will boost your confidence { As Belongingness is inversely proportional to  Stress }\n\n\nSince the families are going nuclear at times it is tough to provide in person solution at right time. So, to mitigate the damage control; if we can built an app that can predict or identify the suicidal tendencies based on the search pattern. Which eventually alerts either a police or family person or counsellor for necessary support. The must necessity is that it has to be built with necessary data privacy TnCs.\nApart from Clinical Psychology, Consulting & Counselling Psychology has to be promoted to larger extent such that it can be considered as a future career thus improving the employment ratio.\nSchools and Educational Institutions and even Companies should be tied-up with Doctors and Counsellors for better Emotional Management and work for improving the Gross National Happiness.\nFinally, If we are getting few suicidal or negative thoughts there is nothing wrong to discuss with near ones or with experts. Community therapy is always helpful and added expert suggestion will help us to refrain to re-trace those thoughts.\n\nFoot Note: According to the National Science Foundation, an average person has about 12,000 to 60,000 thoughts per day. Of those, 80% are negative and 95% are repetitive thoughts. If we repeat those negative thoughts, we think negative way more than we think positive thoughts.\nSTAY POSITIVE & STAY HEALTHY & EAT HEALTHY\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________\nIt is great learning experience during the weekends and holidays of lockdown to learn on this corona virus pandemic.

As  they experience the Showman; they shares the similar experience to his few selected disciples and thus ‘the Rishi’ becomes ‘the Guru’.  Whom have created a way for each and everyone of us (In terms of Personal God) to get us liberated and realize the Showman within ourselves. And then we learnt that people who embark a travel to meet the showman are termed as ‘Brahmacharya’; To get motivated to meet the showman they start to pray the Sun who is more visible and tangible; and then continue their path for the ultimate showman.\nAlert: I will write a simple Analogy for Atman & Brahman in another blog for you to relate future blog series; At this point of time let us assume that there is Showman within us and there is Showman from where we all are connected, whom we will call as universal showman.\nAny Disciple would get a common doubt on their journey for Showman that\n-&gt; If there is Ultimate Showman; Then why does our Innerlight (Our showman} directs differently for each one of us?  How does LokaSamgraha will be achieved?\nAnd then Rishi/Guru responds in this way:\nRishi Smiles and says, ” There are many inter-related questions that you have asked. Let me try my best to guide you in the right path”\n” The purpose of LokaSamgraha comes when we all think; that there is something called as LokaSamgraha! ”\n” Consequently, You have to realize that “You” is also part of Everyone ”\n” After you get acquaintance of this topic, before everybody; you have to start working for the same ”\nRishi pauses and then continues;\n” As I’m seeing your face, your core question looks unanswered i.e.; how does everyone has different paths? ”\n” It is just the nature of our environment i.e.; each life on this planet is not the same. However, every life is interdependent on each-other for its survival and harmony. ”\n” Coming to your point, the good thing about the showman is that whatever we seek and ask him you get his help and the answer. The Core lies on how do you ask him ”\n” If you ask yourself superficially, your thoughts will respond;”\n” If you ask yourself deeply, your subconscious will respond;”\n” If you ask yourself more deeply; there he is your showman; waiting for your arrival;”\n” We usually get carried away by our thoughts and subconscious {which mostly has recency effect} than by hands of our showman that is the reason the paths are different. However, not to mistake or undermine those thoughts are also the products of showman little earlier of our life. ( if they were self exploratory questions as mentioned above ) ”\n” Knowingly or Unknowingly we are all guided by our showman. But to be in constant touch with our Showman. We have to be aware and achieve the state of calmness and steadiness to reach him. ”\n” Gurji, How does i achieve that state of steadiness ? ”\n” You have to do Sacrifice !!! ”\n” I have done a lot of Sacrifice!!! What more should i do Guruji ? ”\n— Answer in next blog\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nGo through the the English translation of this; it is beautiful"

As  they experience the Showman; they shares the similar experience to his few selected disciples and thus ‘the Rishi’ becomes ‘the Guru’.  Whom have created a way for each and everyone of us (In terms of Personal God) to get us liberated and realize the Showman within ourselves.\n\n\n\n\n\nMost Common Questions that Pop-us for few of us is: \n\nWhy the Gurus preached about the Celibacy when the Personal Gods are married\nOn top of it; Why Personal Gods has opted for Polygamy\n\nHope the article will help you to rethink or reframe these questions in a different way.\nWe have discussed in previous blogs where Gurus picks up few of his disciples and trains them to become liberated. They make take few months, years or decades depending upon the time invested by that disciple for the realisation of the Showman. Until finally those disciples become Gurus.\nThe person who is trying to realize the showman is termed as “Brahmacarya”. {Bharaman(Showman) + Charya(Going After)} \nInteresting to realize that “Brahmacarya” can be practised by anybody and there is no gender bias, caste bias, marriage status, age bias etc.; It is all about getting oneself liberated and realize the showman. During the process they would realize they had to empty out the desires and once they realize the showman; they don’t need any internal enforcement to abstain from desires.\nM. K. Gandhi is a recent well-known married Bramacharya. Who Practised Brahmacharya to gain Liberation. He preached and practiced the concepts of Brahamcharya for which he gained the popularity world-wide.\n\n\n\n\n\nGandhi  & His Experiments on Bharamacharya \nConcept of the Brahmacarya (Which is an Over-all LifeStyle for Spiritual Liberation) doesn’t mean Celibacy. The Joy/Bliss that you obtain from realization of showman makes the pleasures that we seek meaningless. It doesn’t translate to otherwise.\nPage-65: Introductory Essay | Bhagavadgita | S. RadhaKrishnan\nOver-All Style usually includes and not limited to Humility, Obedience, Readiness to Serve, Compassion and Gentle Love, Renounce Self-Well and  experience passivity and several others. If you observe closely, these qualities that are more feminine in nature and character. Feminity is in all beings.\nSo, we have to experience Feminity within ourselves and thus Empowering the Shakti within ourselves. (The little well-known purana i.e.; Devi-Bhagavata Purana.) - It can be translated as w/o Shakti it is impossible to realize the showman.\nPersonal Gods that we have seen are the Qualities within ourselves such that if we realize them it would be a path for the God. By the time a person/Rishi/Guru realizes all the qualities in thyself becomes ShaktiMan and have a serene life under the arms of Showman.\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nThe Representation of the above concept has turned into the below visual representation and others. Visual Representation can be many but the realization for the Showman is only One."

    "text": "It’s been long time I have penned my opine. This time, I chose a topic that’s been greatly researched; and been perceived as a “state”.\nIn this article i tried to showcase about my understanding on Happiness (but certainly not talking about Happiness Index- which is damn debatable).\nIt was 3rd Feb of Year 2014 @ 10:30 A.M. I was at Vemulavada (Sri Raja Rajeshwara Temple) along with my larger family. As we are walking on our way to our lodges (after our Dharshan), few of them de-routed to another lane to buy some gifts and other apparels, abandoning my father and me.\n“Dad, what’s in the breakfast”, I asked my father as if it is the next thing on my activity list.\n“Arun, let them come. How are you feeling about your recent endeavour of getting admission to ISB.”\n“I’m feeling happy, Dad”.\n“Are you trying to say that getting admitted into ISB is making you happy. Are you trying to correlate the happiness with respect to external environment?” \n“I could not get you”\nHe said so many philosophical things at that time. But none couldn’t get into my brain. I felt he sensed the same and finally he took his index finger and placed on centre of my forehead and said “Happiness lies here”. I couldn’t get the sense to what my father was saying as I felt that I’m intelligent enough to understand about Happiness from “Google” in a simpler way.  After an year I only realised that “Happiness” is still a fuzzy concept in Philosophy and Psychology. \nLately on 1st of Week of Feb 2018; out of blue, when I was browsing youtube, I found this lovely collated video of Sadguru by Dorothy.\n\nVide Summaries about “5 Things that Happy People do differently”.\n\nLive in Present\nDon’t take yourself too seriously\nTake responsibility for your inner state\nManage yourself not others\nRealise that your not immortal\n\nOnly after 4 years I realised what is meant by “Happiness lies here”. i.e.; Happiness lies within you. \nI will try to explain in simpler way;\nGod has given us many vital organs namely such as brain, eyes, mouth, teeth and several others. If we  take care of them wisely and make use of them optimally/fullest we will be in a state of happiness.\nFor example, most happy people are found to be best programmers, best artists and best authors who use their most wisest organs to be fullest. They use it to the fullest because they are not best but because they have a sense of satisfaction once they use their organs to the fullest, which makes them to be happy.\n\nUsing our Organs at optimal/fullest - Makes us feel Satisfied.\nRealisation of Satisfaction - Makes us feel happy.\nContinuous loop of Point 1 & 2 - A Celebration.\n\nWe don’t need an occasion for a Celebration. All we need ourselves to Celebrate each and every moment of our life.\nA positive mind reflects positivity; A Smile Engenders Smiles; A celebrating soul lives a life;"

    "text": "“Thy King, Thy People” was an age-old adage that we have been listening since childhoods for generations after generations. Does it still hold true in ‘Democracy’? since we (people) elect our own ruler. As I look at it, maybe the old-adage is applicable for families and organizations but when we relate to elections, it might not. Ruler in democratic state represents the majority of the collective mind-set of the people in that country or state at that time.\nWhat is this to do with Consumer Behaviour? To my sense, it gives a different lens, as both the consumer and the voter are the same. It is just that our emotional preference changes from situation to situation.\nFor every elections all the parties comes up with their own value proposition (usually termed in politics as manifesto or agenda). At a thirty thousand feet level, each one of them has their own unique selling proposition to its target market. In politics, the hold on niche market does not help to be the leader of the house (unless there is a hung) but it is of several niche markets that is aggregate to its target market.\nSo, there are some more additional offers that parties usually provide in additional to their manifesto:\n\nSegmented Offers like { Loan waiver for farmers who were hit with floods, Increased Pension etc.; }\nAlso, the previous term development {in both positive and negative way for either of the parties}.\n\nDoes all these logical benefits play a prominent role when it comes to D-Day of voting to that particular party?\nThe answer should be a straight “NO” as \n\nHow many of us have read manifesto and communicated it to others\nHow many of us are part of those segmented offers\nHow many of us really keep a track of government development plans { When we have no time to carve of our development plan }\n\nTherefore I feel, way-back politicians should have discovered the methodology of “Emotional Selling Proposition” {ESP instead of USP}. Now, it is becoming structured with certain organizations behaving as consulting wing for few parties when drafting the manifesto.\nESP helps in establishing the identity with respect to the party by dwelling the customer value funnel of Affiliation, Validation & Identity. \nHow does this happen in reality?\nUsually the people either affiliated or not affiliated. The latter would be easy targetable if we address their pain area. Usually behaviour identification of brand shifting is very harder (because we usually patronize to a regular store/shop without much thinking about it once we start identified with the brand or few of its products)\nSo during the election campaigns, the parties try to highlight/glorify that pain areas and gives oath to the people that they will resolve that pain {during this phase they try to anchor that segment to shift their political affiliation}. Since, each market faces different pain area they change the construct of the campaign communication in each market area. In addition, they try to ensure that they have a different representative face who understands the ground pain of the people who can address it when they are in power. These days with aid of external consultancy; these parties are trying to understand the real ground pains and refine their product and communication offering.\n This all looks good at 30K level above sea level. In the next blog, we will try to observe from sea level where in we will try to take the cues of writing of Zeithmal and Ram as well.\nTo conclude, Daniel Kahneman in his book ‘Thinking fast and slow’ has mentioned that when faced with a choice; we are more likely to act to avert a loss than to achieve to gain.\nNote: 1) The views mentioned in this article are personal views of the author and not affiliated to any parties or organizations. 2) The core product and service execution plays a prominent role in terms of long-term affiliation for the brand/product."

    "text": "In this blog post i would like to discuss a special case of game theory {Non-Cooperative game} within ourselves. Let me run thru basic introduction on game theory. { for new learners }\nGame Theory: { https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory} { Bargaining Problem - By Sir John Nash }\nThose who love Intense Mathematics & Differential Equations can run through the above links. In this blog post, let me explain the beautiful theory with a famous example that is discussed in most of the Text Books.\n\nSituation: There are two thieves { say Mahesh & Ram } have committed a diamond burglary.  Sleuths have gathered basic evidence, but still they need more evidence to imprison them. So, they decided to apply the Non-Cooperative game theory.\n\nThey approached the thieves separately and discussed three scenarios: { And asked them to pick one of these three }\n\nScenario-1: If you did confess and other didn’t: You will get zero years. Other will get 10 years of sentence.\nScenario-2: If both you confess. You both will get 5 years of sentence.\nScenario-3: If both you didn’t confess. Both of you will get 2 years of sentence.\n\n\n\n\n Mahesh/Ram\nDon’t Confess\nConfess\n\n\nDon’t Confess\n2,2\n10,0\n\n\nConfess\n0,10\n5,5\n\n\n\nIn an ideal situation, if both of them are to be safe they should not confess. \nHowever, as they aren’t not loyal to each other. Probability to confess for evading the sentence is high; which is usually called as Prisoners dilemma. And in most cases, it happens to be that they both confesses the crimes.\nDefinition: Game theory is the analysis of a situation involving conflicting interests in terms of gains and losses among opposing players\nThis is a very simple example; the mathematical model and its application for “n” number of players has made by Sir John Nash for which he has awarded with Nobel Prize.\nBlog:\nLet us assume that there are two people { That is Present-You & Future-You }. Let us take a simple decision/situation that we take in our life “We want to maintain our weight & health by consistent work-out”\nThe ideal situation is where-in we can become better-off is by taking time for our daily work-out. Let us see how decision happens for most of us. { It is just a simple example for portraying the outcome for this blog }\nPresent-You has to take two decisions i.e.; to perform work-out or not and similarly Future-You has to accommodate the work-out or no work-out for the future.\nPresent-You thinks that if i take a decision to work-out it would be good. If Present-You didn’t perform work-out; it will all its time and energy to glorify the better present for the future. Such that Future-You has all its time to perform work out.\nSimilarly, Future-You thinks that i would not be able to perform workout as I have to manage my time and energy for future. So, Future-You wants Present-You to perform work out such that upgraded future demands more time and energy than present.\nThis results in a no work-out situation for both Present-You and Future-You. \nI tried to portray through this classic example where we create our daily dilemma that works against us which hinders our health and wellness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPresent You\nPresent You\n\n\n\n\nWork Out\nNo Work Out\n\n\nFuture You\nWork Out\nBest & Ideal Situation\nI can manage present work & Time\n\n\nFuture You\nNo Work-Out\nI can manage future work & Time\nI can manage both work & time at all times\n\n\n\nTo conclude:\nThere are similar situations that arise in our life; where-in we remain in status-quo for long duration of time.\nIt is not that we are afraid to take risks and go ahead. It is just that our own forces work against us albeit we know that the results are always fruitful.\nNote: As Sadguru says - ” The Individual who has to take care of his their own health & wellness is only YOU”.\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nMy favourite scenes from ” A Beautiful Mind” Movie:\nGame theory Explanation"

Ideally, to get a strong and ever-lasting inspiration either we need to hear first hand stories about him or see him every day. \nThus it would be obvious for us to look back about the basic elements of our creation i.e.; Pancha Bhoota.  And then deities like Sun, Moon, Fire, Sky, Earth, Wind, Water etc.; has been started to get worship. These natural form of deities have been mentioned in Rig Veda which represents as one of the earliest phase of evolution of religious consciousness. \nMitra, Varuna & Agni are the three eyes of the great illuminator Sun. When worship is accorded to any of the Vedic deities, we tend to make that deity, the Supreme One ( Showman), of whom all others are forms or manifestations. { Page 33 from The Prinicipal Upanishads by S. Radhakrishnan }\nAs deities presiding over groups of natural phenomena became identified; The Various forms of Sun-Gods tended to be looked upon as one; Usually it is logical to draw inspiration from Sun as it is a lively body which makes us to en-liven ourselves and come out of darkness everyday. { Also, scientifically all the life in this planet is Solar Powered i.e.; gift provided by Sun }\nFor a person who wants to transverse the path from reciting the Hymns to ‘search for the reality underlying’ requires a particular concentration of deity; may be related personal god i.e.; Surya; Who then can further lead to explore the unmanifested one (showman) and gain liberation on his journey of Brahmacarya.\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nIf you are going to start praying Sun; You can blend it with Surya Namaskar;"

His question of “why pooja” made him to realize that it should not be a ritual but a method to concentrate to realize the god.\nWe left the previous blog where Shishya approaches to Guruji and asks , ” If everyone is looking to realize the showman to achieve the state of bliss, Who will do the work Guruji and keep the world running ? ”\nAnd then Rishi/Guru responds in this way: { This answer will be answered through conversations in next three blogs }\n” Who is running the world ? ”\n” Guruji, I mean we as humans are responsible for keeping the world intact and save it for future generations ”\nGuruji Smiled and said, ” World has been running on its own for millions of years. And our Age is minuscule to what the world has seen so far ”\n” Guruji, I mean that we made the living more structured and ease of living is continuously being made convenient for generations ahead. This is also a consistent act of LokaSamgraha as i look at it ”\nGuruji again smiled and said, ” You are very near; but your definitions and its comprehension of the terms made it amiss ”\nRelaxed Shishya suddenly becomes strained and blankly stares at Guruji\n” What happened you looked worried ! ”\n” I’m good Guruji. When you said my definitions are wrong; i was little worried on my thought process ”\n” Every human thought process evolves over time till it achieves the state of being in permanent connection with our showman. Till then we can always improve our thought process and its comprehensions ”\n” Thanks a lot Guruji, can you elaborate as where have i missed ”\n“ LokaSamgraha as it means it is for people welfare i.e.; for all sects of people and not for particular sect of people. Whether we had created more structured or more worse only the future generations can answer this and we cannot ideally. Lastly, it is not the ease of living that has to be made convenient for future generations, it is working for resilient living for happy life”\n” Guruji, by this way each and everyone should co-operate for this act on making future generations. However, it is not a ‘just world’ that we live in ” said the Shishya furiously.\n” Very Good that you have realized that this is not a ‘just world’ ; But who has made it so ? ”\n” I don’t know Guruji ” said Shishya abruptly to avoid answering that question.\nGuruji understood his status quo and continued , ” As i have said a while ago, this world has been running on its own for millions of years. For the world there is nothing like a ‘just world’ or a ‘real world’, this term is only applicable for our species out of many species in this world.”\n” These terms are born out of thought process when we have started interacting with the environment for our survival needs. You have to accept that out of all species, humans have the highest intelligence and this is where we can arrive at what is right and what is not right for our rightful way of living ”\nShishya is a non emotive way said, ” I’m able to recollect to other disciples when you were saying that we have complicated the way of living. ”\n” Very rightly said; before thinking about LokaSamgraha individual has to un-complicate his life around him, only then he can un-complicate the lives around.  Since, we added complexity in our life we are saying that  ‘ it is not a ’just world’ ’ ”\nShishya who has now got into a relaxed mode said , ” Most of the people to earn their livelihood however has to interact with the environment of the  ‘just world’. How can we not complicate our life ? ”\n— Continuation in next blog\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nMy previous blogs for reference -\n\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/learnings-indian-culture/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning101/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning102/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning103/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning104/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning105/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning106/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning107/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning108/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning109/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning110/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning111/"

The Guru has observed that some of their well talented disciples are observing difficultly in attaining permanent connect with Showman ”\n” To help his disciples, that Guru has developed a methodology like praying to showman such that the talented disciples would develop more intense concentration to reach and realize the showman ”\n” Similarly, several other methodologies have been developed over a period of time for a specific purpose to realize showman ”\nShishya asks , ” Why these has become as stringent rules instead of methods ? ” very intensely\nGuruji responds with a smile and answers ,” if the purpose has been lost over the time, the methods are protected as stringent rules; as methods face identity crisis ! ”\nShishya nods his head and answers, ” Yes, i now understood that if i pray for the sake of prayer; the purpose is lost; and it becomes just as a mere activity instead a purposeful ritual ”\nAnd Shishya thinks to himself and asks again , ” Then why so many festivals are brought into our society, Guruji.

Vision is good, but it looks highly impossible that I doubt to pour even a drop in our lifetime. ”\n” Superb!

In our discussion so far, what is the fact, and what is the opinion? ”\nShishya closed his eyes and responded,  ” Fact is the realization that we get influenced/biased from our past. The opinion is one that where you have referred that we need to start from a fresh slate of mind in every moment of our life. ”\n” So, you are deferring the opinion but not the fact.

And you are saying that is not practical. So, I will be anachronistic as per your comprehension ”\n” But I need a solution Guruji ! ” responds Shishya\n” Let me tell you one more fact, in a hurry to look for a solution we do not internalize the fact. So, our realization will be in words but not inside our minds. So ideally, there might be several solutions available for our problems but none seems working for us. Consequentially, we either live with the fact or defer the fact. ”\n” I can connect to this. But why does others’ solution doesn’t seem to be a right fit for us? ”\n” Likewise there are several methods to realize god {refer earlier blog} there are several solutions to a problem. If we concentrate on methods we can never reach the end goal of ours but we might be reaching or working for someone else’s; which is of course not the solution we are looking for. “  responds Guruji\n” How can I find my solution? Your solution is very impractical and others’ solutions would be like a patch fix for that conflict. ”\n” Wonderful Shishya!  I would recommend that instead of finding the solution; try to learn more about your conflict and understand its roots.” answers Guruji to incite interest in Shishya.\nShishya started to ponder to what Guruji said and in few minutes he asks, ” If I just live around these conflicts and try to understand them, when can I reach an ultimate bliss situation and realize the showman. I doubt is there a showman in reality ? ”\n— Answer in next blog\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nMy previous blogs for reference -\n\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/learnings-indian-culture/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning101/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning102/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning103/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning104/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning105/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning106/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning107/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning108/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning109/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning110/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning111/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning112/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning113/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning114/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning115/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning116/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning117/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning118/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning119/"

    "text": "Summary of 24 Blog Post in one go: \nIn this series of posts, we have observed Rishi, who gets enlightened through self-inquiry with a genuine inherent desire to meet the Showman; they would like to come forward to share a similar experience to his few selected disciples; thus, ‘the Rishi’ becomes ‘the Guru.’ These Rishis’ have created a way for us (via Personal God) to get liberated and realize the Showman within ourselves.\nWe learned that ‘Brahmacharya’ are the people who embark on their travel to meet the Showman. So, to get motivated to stay on the journey to pursue Showman, they started to pray to the Sun, who is more visible and tangible; and then continue their path for the ultimate Showman.\nRishis Disciple is now in a confusion mode ( a learning soul will always be in that way). He learned about the inner light dualities among the people and envisaged that his realization of Showman must be a Sacrifice which is nothing to sacrifice that he will realize him. His question of “why pooja” made him realize that it should not be a ritual but a method to concentrate on discovering God. Also, whatever work we do, if we perform as per the direction of Showman, we will attain peace by not thinking about the reward and living out of the vicious loop of Gunas.\nNow Shishya is trying to learn about the pains and their conflicts. He realized that conflict is his image of the past that differs from the present. Also, the conflict will be no more only when one tries to understand the conflict. So finally, he realizes that he must come above his conflict and understand the truth.\nHe started to live with the truth that God is within us and everywhere\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat Next?\n\nOne of my close friends mentioned that the content is good; why don’t you post it as a book after completing your blog series. However, publishing a book requires much more rewriting and adding more details. In this base version of the book, I copy pasted the blogs for binge reading. We will revise this document together in a couple of years and make it better. ( Link for the PDF )\n\n\n\nFew of you resonate that this is good to read. But, most of us cannot relate to the current status quo. So soon, in a couple of months will start writing blogs on “ Contemporary Learnings of Indian Cultures,” which will help us in the current times. I hope you may like that too."

    "section": "",
    "text": "What is SUCCESS:\nBelow reference has been taken from “business dictionary”\nAchievement of an action within a specified period of time or within a specified parameter. Success can also mean completing an objective or reaching a goal. Success can be expanded to encompass an entire project or be restricted to a single component of a project or task. It can be achieved within the workplace, or in an individual’s personal life. For example, if an individual’s personal goal is to be accepted in a new career, success would occur after the individual has been officially accepted into his or her new place of employment.\n\nExample:\nNow let us assume that a person(say a student) success is to get accepted in a good college. Mathematically, the outcome of a success is a boolean outcome that is Yes/No. { i.e.; Either he gets accepted or not }.\n\nUsually, that particular student works hard for the required entrance examination. And he practices many mock tests to minimise the errors in the actual test. Unknowingly, the student has modelled success in his mind as a function of hard work & function of practice.\n\nF(Success) = F(Hard-work) + F(Practice).\n\nGood for the student. He cracked the exam and got into the college that he aimed for. Thus he achieved success.\n\nThe by-product of this success is that the student assumes that his “so called success model” is correct; that is success is a function of Hard-work & Practice.\n\nDuring his graduation process for each semester he uses his best worked success model { as it is already proven according to him } to get better grades. Good for him!!! He got his assumed success in each and every semester.\n\nAnd you have to agree that each time his success model got reinforced in his brain as it is the best success model and can usher him to achieve the endless success in life.\n\nYet again he aimed for the one of the big-4 companies and got succeeded.\n\nAgain and Again his SUCCESS Model got reinforced in his mind.\n\nAs it is a story now let us assume that after one year of his work life he faced his first failure i.e.; he couldn’t get the assumed hike.\n\nAs his conscious thought process already got over-written by his reinforced thinking of his success model. It would be ideally be tough for the person to accept the failure in his model and starts reacting on the failure.\n\nHe further works hard and practices hard and yet in the consecutive year he faces another failure. Then for the first time he starts questioning about his “so called success model”. Then he realises that that the actual model for the success is:\n\nF(Success) = F(Hard-work) + F(Practice) + Residual(or)Random\n\nUpon deeper introspection into his life he realises that the another most important factor that has contributed to his success is his peers. So, he adjusts the success model again as\n\nF(Success) = F(Hard-work) + F(Practice) + F(Peers/Friends) + Residual(or)Random\nHowever, he kept the Residual/Random to be part of the model for his future learning. Because he has believed and reinforced the old adage “FAILURES ARE THE STEPPING STONES FOR THE SUCCESS”.\nTo conclude, we can enjoy the fruits of success; however we should be humble enough to give due credit for the surrounding environment/circumstances that helped us to achieve the success. \nNote: Usually the higher the success a person aims for the larger the model it is and attribution of randomness to success cannot be negated.\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nWhen coming to business we cannot have multiple failures and unexplained Randomness for the business success. As the business has to stand longer than human life.\nSo, on the same lines the Key Performance Indicators are brought into business dictionary to reduce the randomness of the business success and have better controls."

    "text": "Note: After a long hiatus we are back with a new COVID 19 series blogs to create an awareness which is aimed to help the larger community for the current wave and future waves. It is based on Mahesh personal experience from handling covid patients and our combined desk research and consultation.\nOur Earlier Blogs:\n\nCOVID 19 : FACTS & REALTY CHECK - Where I learned about this pandemic - Published on 25th March 2020\nCOVID 19: NETIZEN REACTIONS - Where tried to show case few examples where netizens try to forward without a fact check. - Published on 29th March 2020\nCOVID 19: LESSONS FROM “IN” LAND - Our Learning from Kerala - Published on 5th April 2020.\nCOVID 19 : MEDICAL SCIENCE TO OVERCOME PANDEMIC - My Learning on the Corona Virus on Scientific Terminology. - Published on 15th of April 2020\nCOVID 19: DEATHS , LOCK DOWN & RECESSION - My Opine along with little research on inter relation about the same - Published on 28th of April 2020.\nCOVID 19: FEAR STRESS & SUICIDE - My Opine to high light on the stress and suicide in India SubContinent - Published on 10th of May 2020\nCOVID 19 : TREND, FORECAST & WHEN IT ENDS!!!! - My Small Research with the available data; On Daily basis the relevant charts will be available at https://rpubs.com/arun0710/COVID19 - Published on 6th June 2020\nCOVID 19: THE CONCLUSION) - Closing Commentary on the learnings;  Published on 11th July 2020\n\n________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nWe have left the previous blog series where we have learnt that a lot of research is still going on the Covid virus; but it is utmost importance for us to take care of our health and improve our immune system to tackle such future pandemics.\nLet us start this blog with a simple video of explaining the gist “why there are new strains of virus” video by WHO.\n\n\nWhat are the prominent variants now being discussed ?\nFrom the above video of WHO, we can conclude that the likelihood of the virus mutation increases whenever it gets more opportunities to spread.\nMost viral mutations have little to no impact on the virus’s ability to cause infections and disease. But depending on where the changes are located in the virus’s genetic material, they may affect a virus’s properties, such as transmission (for example, it may spread more or less easily) or severity (for example, it may cause more or less severe disease).\nThere are many virus mutations as per the studies; but that are prominent now in Indian SubContinent are the following:\n\nUK Strain - B.1.1.7\nIndian Strain - B.1.617 { Also, called as Double Mutant }\nSouth Indian Strain - N440K \n\nUK Strain & Indian Strain luckily has been very good in transmission i.e.; being more contagious. Good thing is there no evidence on the severity of the infection been discovered by these virus mutations.\nWhat makes a big deal if it is Contagious? -&gt; It quickly spreads to more people and chance of more hospitalised patients and ICU patients would be increasing giving a stress to the healthcare system. Let us follow the same thumb rules of mask, washing hands, sanitizing, social distancing and keeping healthy. \n\n\nAny Additional Symptoms for New Strains?\nCOVID-19 affects different people in different ways. Most infected people will develop mild to moderate illness and recover without hospitalization.\nMost common symptoms:\n\nfever\ndrycough\ntiredness\n\nLess common symptoms:\n\naches and pains\nsorethroat\ndiarrhoea\nconjunctivitis\nheadache\nloss of taste or smell\na rash on skin or discolouration of fingers or toes\n\nSerious symptoms:\n\ndifficulty breathing or shortness of breath\nchest pain or pressure\nloss of speech or movement\n\nOn average it takes 5–6 days from when someone is infected with the virus for symptoms to show, however it can take up to 14 days.\nHighlighted in blue ones are new symptoms that has been evolved as virus gets mutating.\n\n\nAre the Current Vaccinations Safe for these Virus Strains?\nBoth COVISHIELD & COVAXIN are tested for varied virus strains and found to be very effective. Without thinking a second we can take this vaccine if it is available.\nHardest reality in India is about the availability of vaccines and its management; the discussion is out of scope for this blog.\n\n\nWhy there is sudden exponential rise of cases ?\nAs per recent reuters report it seems the scientific community has highlighted and expressed huge concern about the covid-19 scenario if it is not addressed immediately.\nWhen the scientific community has found the Indian Virus Strain in the Community and learned about its transmission power; They assumed for exponential increase of cases for the below mentioned reasons.\n\nIncreased People Movement without following normal COVID norms\nPopulation Density { Migrant Workers came back to Urban Cities }\nPeople Seeking Normality in Life\nVaccination Drive Started ; Elderly people as well seeking normality in life.\nPeople worked for Elections and other support staff.\n\nThere is always a higher chance of spreading and affecting the Elderly and people with comorb at a higher rate leading to load on healthcare and primarily increased devastating scenes on the ground reality.\n\n\nWould there be a possible new strain of corona that is more stronger ?\nIf left unaddressed, there is high chance the Virus Strain can get mutated to a stronger strain in terms of both severity and contagious; At times there is higher chance that this virus strain would be immune of the vaccines that has been so far developed.\nWhich would be even catastrophic not only for our country but for the whole world.  \n\n\n\nWhat is our current course of action?\nTo avoid such scenarios the course of action has to be following the thumb rules and getting vaccinated as soon as possible.\nStay Home and Take Care\n\n\nCONCLUSION:\n\nGovernment should have been acted with a swift response based on the scientific evidence. A Stitch in time saves nine.\nAlso, the vaccination drive should have been concentrated more on people getting vaccinated  rather depending only on Indigenous vaccine. The damage control could have been better.\nIt is hight time to realize that it not numbers it is people.\nA Mandatory 15 day national lockdown is needed. - A Plead from Scientific Community to Government.\nVaccines are a critical tool in the battle against COVID-19, and there are clear public health and lifesaving benefits to using the tools we already have. We must not put off getting vaccinated because of our concerns about new variants, and we must proceed with vaccination even if the vaccines may be somewhat less effective against some of the COVID-19 virus variants. We need to use the tools we have in hand even while we continue to improve those tools. \nWe are all safe only if everyone is safe.\nWhen there is possibility of open and crowd source data and research; It can be as well on Vaccination and Epidemic Analysis."

    "text": "–Updated with WHO Myth Busters on 6th June 2020 This blog post as well has been co-authored with Dr. Mahesh Kolli.\nFrom the time the COVID-19 pandemic has took its exponential pattern. COVID has become a portion of our daily life. Usually Netizens play a major role with their views and voices to bridge the gap between the government and people\nSo our reactions and their voices are valued because they represent a part of democratic world. However, because of various knee-jerk reactions that we take; the wrongs facts and myths and unnecessary ones become trending and get imbibed in our mind.\nAccording Newton’s third law is: For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction so according to every view we post there will be a portion who agree and disagree. For example, certain people still want to continue the CAA protests; or the guest workers in Kerala seeing the images of migrants want to flee to their own place of origin looking at the images on social media or on TV . Being uninformed or spreading messages that we consciously feel will alter the phase of the pandemic is only doing the opposite. So the messages or images or forwards we share can change lives or make superstition stronger. At this time its safer to choose science over superstition and Common Sense over Herd Sense approach as we all will be affected equally.\n\nOne such whatsapp forward that came to us\n\nDear All,\nTemperature playing a big role….*\n\n\n\n\nCountry\nTemp\nAffected\n\n\nChina\n13 C\n81218\n\n\nItaly\n10 C\n74386\n\n\nUSA\n9 C\n61081\n\n\nSpai\n16 C\n47610\n\n\nIran\n12 C\n27017\n\n\nGermany\n7 C\n37098\n\n\nIndia\n32 C\n650\n\n\n\nSo guys please limit/stop the use of Air Conditioners at home.\nIt is a famous Analytics Concept of Correlation vis-a-vis Causation. Also, to underline the fact the total number of cases in Saudi has crossed more than 1000. Added to it, less number of reported cases may be we tested less. So, do not make these type of myths a trending and keep on forwarding in the groups without a fact check. { Also, there is a neat interview in which is in agreement with the whatsapp forward. Link . Who would like to believe that high temperatures may reduce the viral infection rate}\nFew Other Fake Related Ones:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPandemic Caused by 5G than Virus\n\n\n\n\nIn view of public interest and fact news WHO has published the myth busters\n\n\n\nMB_cold_snow\n\n\n\n\n\nMB_hot bath\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n\n\n\nENG-Mythbusting-nCoV (79)\n\n\n\n\n\nENG-Mythbusting-nCoV (80)\n\n\nAlso, note that the traditional medicines have not shown any evidence in terms of being effective. So, do not kindly believe and develop false hopes on the same lines.\nHowever, the traditional practices of ours that would help us in long term:\n\nNamaste\nWashing Hands and Legs with Soap before Entering the house. { Now, in Apartments can be done once we enter the same }\nBathing every day with Soap. Twice a Day, { Vedas Says - Snana Moola Kriya: Sarvaa }\nWashing Hands and Legs with Soap. Before and after the Food.\nWashing Hands and Legs with Soap. Before and after using the washrooms.\nCleaning the teeth with Neem Twigs or ToothPaste.\nGargling with Salt Water in case of sore throat and in-hale of steam to alleviate the cold symptoms.\n\n\nTo Conclude:\n\nRequest to fo through a similar article shared in HBR Review on the same lines. Link\nIt is our responsibility as a collective team to disseminate the data and information properly under all scenarios.\nIndian Government has taken very bold and great steps to contain the spread. We have to abide by the rules and help each other under this pandemic scenario. { It is easy to be an ArmChair Critic upon Government. However, let us do our best in the respective zones and capacity to help on the same lines }\nSeeing all the trends and measures. Corona will soon be gone from the world. It is just a matter of time.\nOn the same lines, hope Netizens will represent the Nation and trend the facts instead of rumours and be positive and not on false positive side.\n\nNote:\nI got into a mode of ArmChair Critic when every Netizen is posting the screenshot of the money they funded into PMs Relief Fund. [ As why PM is not saying now that he will use the black money to uplift the economy.]. However, i felt it is difficult to perform in actions; I feel one has to become a 1 Day PM to understand his pressure and difficulties they face. Nonetheless, I became a Good Samaritan by doing my bit in respective Relief Funds."

    "text": "The Comprehension of Indian Culture has lost in the personalities of the gods we created and the corresponding norms which were picked from our vedas. The offshoots of these norms have been made to selective tenets to uphold the spirit of the tradition.\nHowever, we had (or) need to follow the societal tenets and norms such that we become not too aloof from the society. This is important as where-in we can start our enquiry as to why such a norm/tenet is there.\nAlas!!! That’s a long route.\nThe Crux of Indian Spirit of Culture can be found in its Upanishads. Most of us including me till now has not read either the Upanishads or the Bhagavadgita ( Essential Quick Summaries of 108 Upanishads ) as it is not a compulsion for us.\n\n\n\nThe Sanskrit term Upaniṣad (from upa “by” and ni-ṣad “sit down”)\n\n\nLet me try to explain the crux of thought process of Upanishads with a trademark example of old movie projector. ( As per my Comprehension )\n How do we view a movie on the Screen; Light has to fall on the movie reel which is been rotated by the wheel/motor system and in-turn that reel image is being imposed on the lens which gets enlarged and seen on the silver screen.\nThis is exactly how we see the world; \n\nLight is our Intelligence\nReel is our Thought Process or Information Available\nWheel is the brain that process the information or thought process\nLens are our senses and can be equated to Eyes\nScreen is the world that we see\n\nBut who is running the show?\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can treat Upanishads as series of research books that has been well explored and written by many brilliant minds who in reality has actually explored the world within.\nTo Conclude, the spirit of Indian Culture lies in understanding the absolute reality by demolishing the myths around us; which has been consistently told to us that great revelations can happen only by inward looking.\nThese are two books written by Sarvepalli Radhakrishna who is the 2nd President of our Country and the unknown coincidence is that we celebrate his birthday as teachers day every year.\nHope you may read them and share your experiences and comprehensions as well. I have just started them."

From these thoughts our actions/buddhi arise which we discussed in our Gunas class. “, Guruji responded with ease to what shishya supposed to an arcane one.\nShishya with a burdened mind asked, ” Since, we will be under constant influence on external environment, isn’t it would be difficult for us to come out of the vicious loop of these Gunas. ”\n” Methods that we have learnt so far acts as a preliminary step to repudiate this vicious loop. i.e.; to have very less to negligible influence of our memory of the past with respect to our present ”\nShishya reacted with instant enlightenment, ” I’m able to connect the pieces Guruji. If we only raise above to these three Gunas only then we will be guided by our showman. ” and reminded this poem.\n“When one rises above the three gunas that originate in the body;\none is freed from birth, old age, disease, and death; and attains enlightenment” (Bhagavad Gita 14.20)\nGuruji started to move to the dining area and on the way he said, ” Ignorance/Inertia is a choice made by ourselves based on external stimuli. Most of our life we are ignorant of many lives around us and we are wielded in darkness ”\nAfter an hour…\nWhilst in midst of his nap shishya woke up suddenly and ran to his master and asked, ” What happens in the due course if our actions hurt others ? ”\n— Answer in next blog\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nMy previous blogs for reference -\n\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/learnings-indian-culture/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning101/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning102/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning103/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning104/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning105/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning106/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning107/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning108/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning109/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning110/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning111/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning112/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning113/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning114/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning115/"

    "text": "Continuing from previous blogs:\nWe have observed where the Rishi who gets enlightened through self inquiry with a true inherent desire to meet the Showman; they would like to come forward to share the similar experience to his few selected disciples; and thus ‘the Rishi’ becomes ‘the Guru’.  Who have created a way for each and everyone of us (In terms of Personal God) to get us liberated and realize the Showman within ourselves. And then we learnt that people who embark a travel to meet the showman are termed as ‘Brahmacharya’; To get motivated to meet the showman they start to pray the Sun who is more visible and tangible; and then continue their path for the ultimate showman.\nRishis Disciple is now in a confusion mode asking about the inner light dualities among the people and again got into confusion when he envisaged that his realization to showman has to be Sacrificed to realize him. His question of “why pooja” made him to realize that it should not be a ritual but a method to concentrate to realize the god. Whatever work we do, if we perform as per direction of showman we will attain peace and not thinking about the reward and living out of vicious loop of Gunas.\nNow Shishya is trying to learn about the pains and its conflicts. And has learnt that the conflict is his past image with respect to the present. Also, the conflict will be no more only when one tries to understand the conflict. Finally, leading him to realize that it is his duty to come above his own conflict and understand the truth.\nWe left the previous blog with this question.\n” I understand that Guruji, but what work should I do by staying with the truth for life long other than staying in bliss. Of course, which is our ultimate goal. I mean after reaching the goal what should I do for the rest of my life. ”\nAnd then Rishi/Guru responds in this way:\n” What do you want to do in your life ? ” asks Guruji.\nShishya closes his eyes for a few seconds and responds, ” I want to stay with Showman forever. ”\n” If you want to stay with Showman forever, what do you have to do? ”\n” Guruji, I have a look inward and follow my inner light. ”\n” You are in the right direction, Shishya. So it is simple, isn’t it so? When you find your Showman, why don’t you ask him what work you have to do for the rest of your life.”\nShishya looks confused, and he feels he is misguided and responds sharply,\n” What is your use of being a Guru Guruji. If you are unable to guide me.”\nGuruji looks at Shishya and nods with a smile.\nGuruji asks again, ” Let me reframe it for you. Showman is the highest Guru, whom you will only meet through your inward journey. So, when you meet your highest Guru, why don’t you ask him directly. Why me? ”\nShishya, who still looks confused, didn’t say a word.\nGuruji continues, ” Say, for example, if your goal is to win an Olympic medal in the running. And I helped my part by coaching you. It is a fact that it is only your sheer effort that will win you many medals. However, after a certain age, you might not be able to compete in the Olympics because of several regulatory restrictions. So what would you do?”\n“Maybe I will become a coach. (or) I participate in other competitions (or) maybe pick another sport that doesn’t have any restrictions.”\n” Perfect! ”\n” So, you are not stopping. You are trying to stay with your ultimate bliss through other methods or activities,” responds Guruji\nand continues, “The Truth remains the same. So, we must understand what we need to do to stay in that Truth forever. To not to lose our connection with the Showman.”\n” So, you mean to say that I would discover what I would do for the rest of my life only when I reach the showman.? ” asks Shishya instantly.\n” Most of us realize the Truth. But we won’t stay in that Truth for longer periods. We understand what it is but seldom comprehend it. ” responds Guruji with a calm and pleasant smile.\nand continued, ” What do you have to do if you need to comprehend the ultimate truth.”\nShishya delves into his deep thinking and responds with his eyes closed, ” If I understood the process that made me realize the Truth. Then I will try to hinge on that process to stay in a more extended period or forever with the Truth. The process is like preparing for running, and the goal is like winning medals. ”\nAnd Shishya continues in his heightened realization, ” When resolving our internal conflict, we understand only the temporary Truth. It isn’t possible to stay in that provisional Truth. But when we know the process of determining the conflict. We come above the conflict and remain with the Truth forever. Ultimately, this is the “process” that will stay with me for my journey for the rest of my life. Dhanyotsmi Guruji! ”\nAfter a while, for a change, Guruji asks, ” Since you understood the process of attaining Truth. Can you describe the process ?”\n— Answer in next blog\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nMy previous blogs for reference -\n\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/learnings-indian-culture/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning101/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning102/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning103/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning104/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning105/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning106/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning107/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning108/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning109/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning110/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning111/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning112/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning113/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning114/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning115/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning116/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning117/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning118/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning119/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning120/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning121/"

    "text": "Continued from previous blog - Link\n\n\n\n\n\nA few years ago,\nA young girl in her early twenties, draped in an exquisite blue coloured silk saree, nervously waiting for her loved one outside an Engineering college. \nHer dilated eyes turned misty when she saw a resembled face from a distance, and then she started flying towards him and hugged him tightly and said, “I love you, Sanjay”. { Yes, this is the same Sanjay of the first Episode }\n“Pooja, there are so many students and lecturers around”.\nShe heard nothing but clutched him more tightly as if he would slip away from her. \nSanjay responded by kissing her forehead and said, “Love you too, Pooja”,\nAfter feeling his kiss, Pooja came to her senses and said, “I’m sorry, Sanjay. I couldn’t stop myself as we are meeting after a couple of years”.\nHe took her to the nearest Ganapathi mandir, which is a few miles away from his University and vowed that he would never leave her hand under any circumstances.\n“I’m incredibly sorry that I had to ditch you because of our minor misunderstandings at that time. I never imagined you would come over again for me.”\n“Thanks to social media, I have been following you under a ghost account for the last year. So, it was effortless to find you and your Univ. But, you never felt to look for me, Sanjay, after we broke up?”\n“I did. But I felt guilty about what I did for you? I’m sorry,” Sanjay said as tears rolled out his eyes.\nPooja kissed his cheek and said, ” I love you. Let us be together again forever.”\n“It is tough to find a loved one. It’s tougher to find a loved one who knocked on your door. How can I leave you?”\nThey hugged inside the temple as if air couldn’t pass through them. They spent their time till dawn and had a sumptuous dinner in a nearby eatery, and later Sanjay dropped her at her University, which was just two hundred miles away.\nIt took a year to find out for Pooja that Sanjay was running a parallel story along with Swati, Sanjay’s classmate.\nShe came to know this when she decided to surprise Sanjay for Valentine’s day; however, to her surprise, she saw them going into a theatre cuddling each other. At that moment, she wants to quarrel with him then. But, out of her unparalleled love towards him, she left the place in tears.\nPooja felt that if she showed her true love to him, he would return with unconditional love. So she waited a couple of months to see whether Sanjay would confess to his behaviour. But, it never took to that course of action.\nPooja doesn’t want to turn this into a bitter relationship and a nasty breakup. But chose to avoid him consistently in the name of her career and aspirations. In the beginning, it turned him off; nonetheless,  having a backup, he picks to settle with Swati rather than search for true love.\nOn the other side, Pooja sobbed for months to overcome this trouble backstabbed relationship.\nBack to Present in Psychotherapy Clinic\n” Please wait outside or speak to my receptionist for the next queue. I’m already engaged with a client”, said Swati’s mother, the therapist.\nReceptionist said, “Sir, there is a waiting for 30 mins. I request you to please wait in the lobby”.\n“Sure”\nHe walked towards the lobby and saw a beautiful woman draped in a blue saree. She looked engrossed in reading a cine magazine, and it took a while for his dull mind to recognise that she was none other than Pooja. \nHe felt on cloud nine to see her at the right time and thanked God for this moment. \n” Pooja, How are you?”\nPooja casually looked at Sanjay, then got excited to see him again after a couple of years and said, ” I’m amazing. How are you?”\n” I’m fantastic too.”\n” How come you are here, Sanjay ?”\n” I came here for a counselling session; I’m going through a tough phase in my life. And how come you are here, Pooja? Are you here for counselling too?”\n” No”\n” Let me guess. Are you working here?”\nShe smiled and said, “No. But I’m surprised that you contemplated a counselling session. These days men are evolving as vulnerable and untrained to manage themselves.”\n“Times change, Pooja, and men have a heart too! And I couldn’t stop flattering you; you look ravishing and stunning.”\nPooja beamed and said, “Thank you!!!!”\n” It is fine. But, first, tell me why you are here?”\nPooja smiled and said,” I’m here for my Husband. He is presently having a counselling session with the therapist.”\n&lt;&lt;&lt; To be Continued &gt;&gt;&gt;"

    "title": "Emotional Hangover",
    "section": "",
    "text": "What is Hangover?\nWe all know about Hangover to put in simple and my way “it is just hanging around unconsciously”.\nWhat is Emotional Hangover?\nThere are many definitions and my way to put is “ Hanging unconsciously with a dense of emotions ”. \nWhy and how can there be an Emotional Hangover? Emotional Hangover as I look at it; starts with normal symptoms such as lack of focus, anxiety, tension in the body, lack of motivation towards our health and few others. If we do not recognize these emotions they may aggravate and will effect our own life. \nTo note, any bad incident that happens in our life can never be erased. It can only be forgotten.\nLet us read this small story snippet to learn how Emotional Hangover kills us.\nStory Snippet: { Story in First Person }\nHi Friends, my name is Rahul Sharma. Most of my friends and especially my close friends and well wishers used to say that “You are good at almost every thing, however if you can control your emotions; you reach to new heights”. I used to think that “Lack of controlling our emotions is a cult and ignored it”.\nI realised that our true emotions comes out when our personal spaces overlap. Of course, when we are in relationship it is certain. Her name is Supriya, in initial days she enjoyed my love to full extent. Being more emotional ( as a lover we may not be able to control our emotions ) made her more gifted, excited and thrilled. Later after few months, my emotions led to break up. This made my emotional hangover further carried over to “alcohol over”.\nLater, after an year I have joined in my first company. In enthuse and being carried with the same emotional hang mentality, I was liked by all managers. The reason is being my stupendous productivity and involvement. However, later these own emotions again made myself complicated; leading my colleagues deserting my companionship; which finally lead to my resignation. This further made me loose my confidence, productivity, health, my goal and few others.\nLater, after couple of years when my emotions regained to its normal state; and after thorough analysis within myself I felt that in both the episodes; i.e.; in my love as well as in my career my view is 100% right. It went wrong only in my expression. My analysis and thinking is perfect but when I’m expressing my views, my emotions over ruled unconsciously. That showcases a different picture leading for unnecessary conclusions on my personality. Certainly, when we are in high emotional state our unconscious brain hinds our conscious process of thinking making us difficult to express to what we want to express.\nAlso, being more emotional becomes a tool for others to fulfil their interests and goals.\nI would like to stop the story at this juncture and leave the ending and conclusion to  your imagination.\n\nTo Conclude, Self Disciple and Self Control towards our own emotions certainly will lead to a happy and prosperous life.\n\nTo Note, even a small tweaking in our daily habits like daily jog/morning prayer will certainly lead to larger benefits of controlling our emotional hangover. “ What do you think the reason for it? is it a Domino effect?”"

    "text": "By nature humans look to reduce the burden of their regular work. This is because we usually get bored by banal work. And this has propelled humans to think in a visionary way to place future generations in a comfort. On the other side, there are just around 1000 best inventions that has changed the world i.e.; from ‘Controlled Fire’ to latest 3D Printing.\nQuick Summary of Uber View of Inventions:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMileStone\nTime Period\nNo. of Inventions\n\n\nThe Ancient World\n1,420,000 B.C. to 100 B.C\n200\n\n\nFrom Rome to Revolution\n100 B.C. to 1800 A.D.\n120\n\n\nThe Industrial Age\n1800 A.D. to 1860 A.D\n120\n\n\nRifle Ages\n1860 A.D to 1890 A.D\n110\n\n\nModern Age\n1890 A.D to 1915 A.D\n120\n\n\nWar & Peace\n1915A.D to 1950 A.D\n120\n\n\nGoing Global\n1950 A.D. to 1969 A.D.\n110\n\n\nThe Internet Age\n1969 A.D to 2010 A.D\n100\n\n\n\n\n1000\n\n\n\nIndustrial Explosion has created a number of opportunities for inventions. Think about a person who was born in year 1950s and still alive; they might have experienced approximately 200 inventions during their life time. What they have seen is that world is expanding in quick time. In the above table if we had drawn another column say global population. The Invention Index Upon Population would be on a decreasing trend.\nIt is not that the people have become more lazy during the years. It is only that the inventions in the earlier ages were visible. So, identification of opportunity isn’t a difficult but the methodology of invention was very difficult.\nAs we progressed, the implementation of invention and reachability of invention to larger people has became prominent as the opportunity identification of invention has become difficult than the methodology itself. {Except a few}\nSo on a survival note, that old person of 1950s communicate to their children as how privileged the current generation and how they should be smart in using the inventions for their better comfort and living in the society.\nIn reality, all of a sudden what we experience is to have more time at our perusal than our earlier generations. To quote a small example: paying an electricity bill in 1990 used to took at-least 20 minutes and in 2018 it takes hardly a minute through Paytm. So, what this generation experiences is that they have more time at their perusal than the earlier generation.\nThe main challenge is that what do we do with balance 19 Min…. i.e.; our brain would be idle for 19 min and we all know from the famous adage i.e.; Idle man’s brain is devil’s workshop. And now,  no one has guided us on how to use this balance time; so we leave it on auto-mode. { In any generation, after our survival needs are met we had a leisure which was usually on an average used to spent with family, society, work, career etc.; { for some work is a survival need }. }\nIn auto-mode as we are not steering ourselves; we usually react to the situations because survival instincts come into play. Which makes us to think in a negative way.\nSay for example, we would like to kill the available time by taking to our love. However, love’s mobile was on waiting. The immediate activity for most of the youth is to call their love until they pick the call and later to only hear the word “Lets break up”. This usually happens because we get impatient and construct a negative imaginary world in quick time.\nOur survival instincts are so powerful that it can think in multiple dimensions in quick time; but it is difficult to harness and maintain that power for a regular living. Leading only to damage our own inner peace. Quick solution that most of us get us is to divert our thinking on something else like reading, watching tv etc.; Which is like taking a pill and sleeping than arresting the root cause. \nAs most of you might have read more ‘self help’ books than me; I would like to conclude the blog by saying that - If we want to steer our life into a happy zone we have to steer our thinking into a positive direction by taking the control of our thinking. The solution is not about managing the free time. It is about how are we living in free time in qualitative terms. Once we start living in those chunks of free time we start living in the moment and thus in our life. \n                                        Our Thinking - Our Life."

    "text": "Before moving to the next series, I felt like sharing some glossaries with the audience, which makes the understanding more complete and starters can connect the dots.\nI have planned for three blog posts that will get published over the next month or so. Maybe I will add more in the future.\n\n\n\n\n\nLet us recollect the first blog of the previous series ( Link). ( Rewriting a part of it which is required for this blog )\nHow do we view a movie on the Screen; Light has to fall on the movie reel which is been rotated by the wheel/motor system and in-turn that reel image is being imposed on the lens which gets enlarged and seen on the silver screen.\nThis is exactly how we see the world; \n\nLight is our Intelligence\nReel is our Thought Process or Information Available\nWheel is the brain that process the information or thought process\nLens are our senses and can be equated to Eyes\nScreen is the world that we see\n\nBut who is running the show? \n\n\n\n\n\nIn the above explanation, we see the world from our thought process or, to simply put - “We see what we want to see.” We term this as “MAYA.” It is the same “Maya” we often hear from our elders or texts, which translates to “nothing is real, but it is merely objects of our projections/perceptions.”\nNow let us assume that there is no reel, meaning there is no thought process or information available. Then, we just ‘SEE’ it. But who helps us to see? Is it not all by ourselves? If we observe newborn kids, whenever they see something new, they stare at it for some time and respond as per the environment. As we grow, our thought process comes into play, so we PROCESS & SEE. When we SEE rather than PROCESS & SEE, we remove our prejudiced beliefs and start learning, accepting, and seeing new information, thus gaining more clarity of the context. As we reduce our pre-processing unit, the internal energy/force can be diverted for our benefit; therefore, enjoying a less stressful life and attaining more clarity leads to a peaceful life.\nTo remove that PROCESS from our equation requires a conscious effort. At times this happens by luck or due to survival necessity. Linking back to the movie theatre example, what do we see on the screen if there is no reel? We will see the light coming from the projector, and now the showman is running the show, but no movie is playing. Then who is the showman? Showman is that guiding force within us that wants to enlighten us. So, to meet the showman, we need to make that conscious effort to remove the MAYA. The showman or this consciousness to be aware of MAYA clutches is termed “ATMAN.” Atman means nothing but our true “Self” which wants to guide us. If we stay with Atman forever, we will be liberated and peaceful.\nThen what is BRAHMAN?\n– Will explain in next blog\n________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nI hope I have tried to explain the concept in a better way and in easy way. Please leave your feedback."

    "text": "If we just google “Pyschographic ” we will decent material for our consumption. However, this article is not intended on those lines. Hope you will find it interesting.\nOne day i felt very enthusiastic and started to think about it while i was on my way to  Diamond Garden in Chembur, Mumbai which is approximately 2 Kms from my living place. Being a Sunday, I woke up late that day and usually my regular chores gets shift by 2 to 3 hours. \nWhile i was walking i came across two small entrepreneur and one transportation system\n\nIf you have travelled to Mumbai or living in Mumbai; you would come across Local. How do we apply Psychographic in this context?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere is a picture of a newspaper vendor near Chembur Station. How do we aly Psychographic in this context?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere is a picture of a idli vada vendor near Ambedkar Garden. How do we apply Psychographic in this context?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, in order to understand the implementation context i have to understand its business. In absence of right availability person for Mumbai Locals; have approached these two entrepreneurs and started conversing with them.\nNewspaper Delivery Business: He wakes up at 3:30 A.M. in the morning for which he places the indents before day itself and collects the newspaper from one location. And in early morning he and his team sorts the newspaper and writes the apartment name and flat number such that the delivery boy will not misplace it while delivering {There is no digitisation in this system}. He has to ensure that at maximum he has to finish the delivery before 8:30 A.M. in the morning. Coming to revenue he earns approximately 20% on each news paper. All news papers except TOI will take back the leftover newspaper next day only at total cost and not the day after day.\nWhen asked his current pain point. He enumerated the following: 1) risk of loosing to competitor in case of delay. As customers these days are not happy with delay in newspaper delivery 2) risk of misplacing or missing a news paper. Which usually irate the customers.\nIdli Vada Vendor: His business is simple where he bring 40 plates of idli, vada along with couple of chutneys which are made early in the morning at his home. He earns approximately 20% to 25% {as there is no retail space or shelf space to be paid except to some other officials at times}. The main challenge for him to avoid the wastage as there is no possibility of extension of shelf life. Usually on an average 40 plates seems be a no wastage for him as per his customer flow. However, when there is a wastage he gives its to other days. Additional cross sell that he does is selling a 500 ml water bottle.\nWhen asked his current pain point. He enumerated the following: 1) risk of un-sell idlis or vadas.\nThere is no price threat to him as he is the cheapest in that location at that time.\nSo, coming to the blog purview. How do we apply psychographic in these business contexts?\nAnswer is that we cannot apply psychographic from the business purview. This is a realisation to me that we have to see from “Customer” purview and may be we re-define or create alternatives such that it helps or addresses to the consumers.\n\nTo conclude, I visit two coffee shops one sells at 30 Rs and other sells at 250 Rs. Apart from product and quantity differentiation; that particular coffee shop has positioned its format differently vis-a-vis the other one."

RadhaKrishnan writings on “The Bhagavadgita”; felt like writing this blog piece.\nContinuing from my previous blogs -\n\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/learnings-indian-culture/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning101/\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe components of reproducible research are data documentation & discussion, methodology discussion and the output publication.  \nUpanishads are said to be composed based on the learnings from rishis; these writings spanned across centuries and few even mentioned that each-one added to the existing literature at that time. However, neither the composer names nor the Rishi names are mentioned in the texts. With this clause ideally the Upanishads are deemed not to be considered as a reproducible research.\nThe most strangest thing that strike to me is that “if someone is thinking something esoteric and is doing for larger good and thinking a lot about longterm for the welfare of humanity; why did they go author-less”; “Now everyone is an author including me. ( Being Sarcastic here for last 7 words  )”\nLet us pick from where we left at the last blog. i.e.; Rishis got a place that is free from distractions such that they meet or understand about the showman. Upon deep introspection and internal inquiry the highest intelligent Rishi would gain few important revelations which in-turn would make him happy.\n\n\n\n\n\nFig: Ananda Valli - From Taittriya Upanishad { Do not confuse with Maslow Hierarchy }\nAs Happy person would attract more friends. A bliss-full soul attracts many disciples. So, ‘that’ Rishi would have attracted disciples and he would have shared his knowledge and revelations i.e; primarily about the output discussions & methodology to gain bliss. \nAmong those disciples he would pick few disciples who are deemed fit and trained them on how to experience the bliss; thus creating more rishis for their Ananda. This is the selfless action performed by the Rishi for the benefit of the others. Which is termed as Karma Yoga.  { This act is the highest form of reproducible research as you are not only ensuring the work is been shared but also ensuring that your work is being experienced by other person in front of us. }\nThus Rishis not only ensured that their learnings are carried forward to the right person. But also ensured that he gets to the fullest of his learnings such that he can built on top of their learnings.\nThus the Vedas and Upanishads has been composed after several sequential learnings by may rishis and maharishis.\nNote:\n\nBhagavadgita or the Upanishads are usually conveyed as the subjects that you should read after retirement as its learnings would make us to cease action.\n\nHowever, Bhagavadgita is all about convincing Arjuna to go to war. i.e.; to take action and not to cease the action."

    "text": "1) How does it look and what is its special to draw attention?\nCoronaviruses were first found in humans in the 1960s. The name is derived from their appearance under the microscope: The peplomers, the outwardly protruding protein structures of the virus envelope, are arranged in the form of a crown (from Latin: corona).\n\n\n\nFig2: Microscopic Image of Corona Virus\n\n\nCoronaviruses are common and infections are often harmless with patients developing only flu-like symptoms, such as fever, cough and shortness of breath. Gastrointestinal complaints, especially diarrhea, can also occur. The incubation time for a coronavirus can vary from a few days to two weeks.\nHowever, coronaviruses are also dangerous and can mutate. They are RNA viruses and have high genetic variability, meaning they can easily overcome barriers between different species. Often, an outbreak among humans originates with other mammals, rodents or birds. \nAs a consequence, the infections also can take more severe paths, causing respiratory distress and pneumonia, which can even lead to death.\n\n\n\nFig3: CoronaVirus\n\n\n\nIf it is already discovered in 1960s. However, it is different from original corona virus and hence it is called also as Novel-Corona Virus since its RNA has been mutated and became better through Darwin theory. The interesting aspect in this virus is that has got better. \n\nBy seeing the shape of Corona, you can see that the virus looks a spherical ball with some miniature protruding rough structures. Usually these structures helps itself to dock on the host cells and invade in it. This novel virus has got better at docking perfectly with our host cells than earlier ones { 20 times more likely to bind/stick to our cells than earlier one } which becomes one of the prime reasons for its rapid progress. { Technically, it docks on ACE-2 receptor }\n\nOnce it docks, these viruses hijacks the cell and creates more copies of its own viruses. This will lead to increase in viral load in the humans. It got better in creating shorter as well longer viral copies without hampering much of its original RNA. Another clever aspect of the Virus is that it has the ability to de-activate the anti-viral properties present in the cell there by chance of reducing the immunity. However, that depends on the viral load and innate immune response system present in the body. { Innate Immune System - Is like soldiers which attack anything that is foreign in our body. Specific Immune System - Upon learning about the disease it attacks like a sniper or strategic surgical strike to the virus/bacteria/pathogens/parasites etc .; }.\n\n\n\nFig4: Clinical Similarities between SARS-Cov and COVID-19\n\n\nBeing soo near to zoonotic and coronavirus family. It is got special attention being soo contagious because of it survival instinct. { Which we will see in the below section. Earlier SARS is used to spread from Moderate to Severe Symptomatic patients only. However, this novel Corona spreads from Asymptomatic ones as well }"

    "text": "2) How a positive case for Corona is been identified? How can someone be Asymptomatic or Symptomatic\nFrom the previous question we have learnt that the virus is novel and then it improved its docking system and then it have been good at developing it viral copies without much hampering its original RNA. After some time the virus will start to have significant copies of its original which is medically termed as Viral Load.\n\nViral load, on the other hand, relates to the number of viral particles being carried by an infected individual and shed into their environment. “The viral load is a measure of how bright the fire is burning in an individual, whereas the infectious dose is the spark that gets that fire going,” says Edward Parker at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.\n\nIdeally, after significant viral load we will show symptoms of corona virus which we are well aware.\n\nIncubation Period: The “incubation period” means the time between catching the virus and beginning to have symptoms of the disease. Most estimates of the incubation period for COVID-19 range from 1-14 days at 99% Confidence Intervals, most commonly around five days. These estimates will be updated as more data become available.\n\nThis particular virus attacks the upper respiratory track during the 1st week after showing its symptoms { posts which symptoms reduces } and then moves towards the lower respiratory track i,e.; lungs and leading to further criticality.\n\nThe way to test the viral load is through any or all of the ways for better conclusive ways - Specimen types include: upper airway specimens (pharyngeal swabs, nasal swabs, nasopharyngeal secretions), lower airway specimens (sputum, airway secretions, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid), blood, feces, urine and conjunctival secretions. Sputum and other lower respiratory tract specimens have a high positive rate of nucleic acids and can be collected preferentially.\n\nDepending on the viral load i.e.; infection rate and our immune response system the cases can be classified in the following way.\n\n\n\nFig5: Taken from HandBook of COVID-19 Prevention & Treatment from Chinese Medical College\n\n\nThis particular Corona has learned to start spreading before the person start showing the symptoms i.e.; 48hrs to 24 hrs before the onset of symptoms { Like Flu }. This where albeit the person is asymptomatic the virus starts spreading through the droplets format.\nAlso, a person can be completely asymptomatic { i.e.; no symptoms} in the complete viral cycle except a little spike in temperature which would not even be noticed. However, they would be carriers of the virus of the disease through droplets till their immune system removes the virus from the body. { It is assumed of being more asymptomatic in the scientific research world that the virus rna might be weaker or the immune response system had got better at produced right set of antibodies in restricting and removing them }\n\nAlso, how does it spreads? - Zoonoses usually would be transmitted through direct contact between animals and humans as well as — like with many germs — simply through the air, such as by coughing or sneezing. But there are many other ways of infection, for example through food or vectors. A mosquito, tick or other insect can transport a pathogen from the host to another organism without becoming ill itself. In addition, zoonoses can also be transmitted via food, for example when eating meat or animal products. If these are not sufficiently heated or if they were prepared under unhygienic conditions, they also represent a source of infection."

    "text": "3) What are the secondary diseases it might get ?\nThe good thing is that in majority of the cases the secondary infections are not observed upon the infection of this virus.\nAs we have seen in the Critical Cases of Fig5 as the severity goes up the oxygen level in the body comes down which is termed as hypoxemi which can lead to cytokine cascade { a situation where large number of white blood cells are released to deal with the infection leading to severe inflammation } and severe infections that might develop into shock, tissue perfusion disorders and even multiple organ failure. Due to this there is a chance for bacterial or fungal infection for the patients.\nAlso, as we learnt that the Corona Virus docks in ACE2 receptor cells. These are higher in number for the elder patients who have pre-existing diabetic, cardiac & chronic kidney diseases. { Because they are prescribed with some medication which will lead to increase in ACE2 receptor cells to mitigate those diseases patterns on daily basis }; further leading to increased viral load.\nUsually, the critical patients with pre-existing complication which are primarily related heart and lungs would be more risk due to this cytokine storm; which is the reason for majority of the elderly patients who died in Italy doctors couldn’t certify the cause of death as Corona Virus."

    "text": "4) How Supportive Care & Medication works in recovery\nIn first three questions we have learnt about the intelligence of Virus on how it hijacks our immune system for its survival. Further leading to hospitalisations and deaths {both are lower in number when compared to affected people}.\nIn this piece we will learn how doctors are helping for the speedy recovery for the patient when WHO has said it clearly that there is no prescribed medication and vaccination yet for this virus. Usually supportive care is suggested for the patients by WHO which is aimed at incentive removal and fluid recovery.\n\nHowever, few countries are saying this - An early antiviral treatment can reduce the incidence of severe and critical cases. Although there is no clinical evidence for effective antiviral drugs, currently the antiviral strategies based on the characteristics of SAR-CoV-2 are adopted according to Protocols for Diagnosis and Treatment of COVID-19 book at our disposal.\n\nBelow is the write-up the ideal situation; however, i have read the cases where for less severe patients as well the anti-virals are provided.\n\nIdeally\nIn mild to moderate cases the sufficient supportive care in terms of IV fluids and anti-inflammatory drugs { It has also been hypothesized that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may worsen COVID-19. Currently, there are no data suggesting an association between COVID-19 clinical outcomes and NSAID use. } will be provided to the patients helping the patients in natural recovery with aid of anti bodies fighting with the virus.\n\nHowever, if the cases are advancing to severe and critical additional supportive like intubation, anti-shock & anti-hypoxemia are used to restore the body to normal and keep fighting. However, in case the patients are leading to high criticality and leading to death like scenarios the following drugs are recommended.\n\nThe drugs that are currently mentioned below are lab tested and there is no proof yet that these will work for the larger audience. Since, any ways the patient is going to die so as a last try let us try this medication. Also, these drugs has their regular side effects.\n\nSince most of the cases when absence of W.H.O options we usually look for USA CDC Options. We have done the same and here is the link. { On April 25th CDC has removed all the below mentioned as the evidence is not yet sufficient and FDA has not to mentioned it officially }\n\nBy intuition, any anti-viral drug is aimed to decrease the viral copies and viral load; So, here they are.\n\nDrug1: REMDESIVIR - This drug assumed to fight Corona by confusing the Corona RNA and further making it to stop creating more copies by becoming its one of the segment. There is success story for the usage of first patient in US. There has been rise in stock prices for this drug manufacturers.\n\nDrug2: HCQ - It is learned that Zinc Ions will suppress or tries to switch off the viral copying machine in the cell. Ideally, Zinc Ions is difficult to traverse through the cell and shut it off. So, here comes the HCQ which acts as a Ionophore i.e.; medium in passing on this Zinc Ions into the cell and thus helping for the recovery. In France, there is success for a less statistical sample patients where patients using the HCQ has been the higher recovery rate and less death rate. Also, there has been rise in stock prices for this drug manufacturers.\n\nDrug3: IVERMECTIN - This drug stops the clever activity of the corona virus i.e.; weakening our immune system of de-activating the cell anti-viral properties. This has shown almost 95% reduction in viral load in the labs in 48 hours.\nHope all these drugs will work out for the humanity cause.\n\nAlso, as mentioned in earlier blogs the US FDA has given recommendation for investigation of Convalescent Plasma Trails { i.e.; blood of recovered person will be used for the treatment for the infected person }"

    "text": "6) Is there a possibility of Re-Infection\nThe Scientists still say that there is anecdotal evidence of reinfection but they don’t know yet. Because in ideal situations anti-bodies should be able to identify the virus in quick unless the virus is heavily mutated.\n\nHowever, by browsing we had find a paper which is not yet peer reviewed - Link should not be considered for conclusive evidence yet. Where they have experimented with virus with monkeys and then they have concluded that the Re-Infection rate for this Novel Coronavirus is near negligible.\n\nAlso, we have been hearing from other scientific community as since this is RNA viruses the mutation of this corona virus is possible in long future and where the re-infection rate is also plausible.\n\nTo end this section on a happy note - “The evidence is increasingly convincing that infection with SARS-CoV-2 leads to an antibody response that is protective. Most likely this protection is for life,” says Martin Hibberd at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine. “Although we need more evidence to be sure of this, people who have recovered are unlikely to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 again.”"

    "text": "7) How Vaccine will help to overcome\nThe possible time-line for Vaccine to be available in the market is between 10 to 18 months i.e.; earliest date would be this year end.\n\nVaccine work is at very high speed and well known scientists are working at rocket speed to contribute the same. [ Also Bill and Melinda foundations are sponsoring maximum number of trials ]\nThere are approximately 50 odd vaccines at WHO which are clinical stage and pre-clinical stage. Hope at-least handful of vaccines are available for us very soon and all clinical trials will be successful. Usually the sample size is increased in two to three levels and monitored for all the re-infection rates and side effects. Since, any vaccine that is given without proper study can do more peril than actual virus itself since it is given for larger audience.\n\n\n\nFig6: Some Vaccines at different stages\n\n\nVaccines are usually nothing but the virus which is sent to human body such that antigens and antibodies i.e.; our specific immune system develops before the real virus hits us.\n\nDifference in real virus vis-a-vis vaccine virus is that in vaccine any of the following can be used:\n\nLive-Virus which is weakened can be given to us and which has less chance of replication.\nVirus proteins along with other pathogens like flu virus which is harmless is given to us\nSynthetically prepared Virus.\nDead Virus which cannot be replicated.\nPlant Derived Virus Like Particles\n\nNote: BCG Vaccine for COVID-19 has not been approved by WHO. [ As earlier there is study that BCG Vaccine is helping to build the innateimmune response system which is leading to fighting the virus in quick time }\nAdditional Info on Vaccination & Immune Response System:\n\nWhen the body is invaded by bacteria, a virus or parasites, an immune alarm goes off, setting off a chain reaction of cellular activity in the immune system. Macrophages or other innate immune cells, such as basophils, dendritic cells or neutrophils, may be deployed to help attack the invading pathogen. Those cells often do the job, and the invader is destroyed. But sometimes, when the body needs a more sophisticated attack, it turns to its T-cells and B-cells. These cells are the special ops of the immune system—a line of defense that uses past behaviours and interactions to learn to recognise specific foreign threats and attack them when they reappear. T cells and b cells are more like the Indian RAW soldiers spies or paratroopers they need activation for special missions.\n\n\n\nFig7: Cells of the immune system and the progenitor cells they are derived from\n\n\nOur acquired immunity—also called adaptive immunity—uses T-cells and B-cells when invading organisms slip through that first line. These cells take longer to develop, because their behaviours evolve from learned experiences, but they tend to live longer than innate cells. Adaptive immune cells remember foreign invaders after their first encounter and fight them off the next time they enter the body. This is the fundamental premise for how vaccines work—using a small, harmless amount of protein from a disease to allow the immune system to recognise that protein if the pathogen were to invade the body. T-cells are made in the bone marrow, like all red and white blood cells. The name T-cell comes from the organ where they mature, the thymus.\nTo Conclude:\n\nThis particular post of mine is a standing ovation from my side to all the medical professionals who are working day and night to end this pandemic.\nAlso, knowledge gives more power and clarity of thought which will help us differentiate between facts and myths/fakes. __________________________________________________________________________________\n\nIt is great learning experience during the weekends and holidays of lockdown to learn on this corona virus pandemic.

    "text": "I found myself on my reading desk with my left cheek on it. Slowly I made my spine straight and started massaging my forehead with my index finger such that my right eyebrow edge rests on my thumb. This is my usual style while I’m in deep thinking.\nNow it is 6:20 A.M.\nI smiled and said to myself “Three nights on a row on reading table. Wow!!!”.\nAfter my quick refreshment, had couple of brown bread slices along with a glass of low fat cow milk (sugarless); and then I’m back to my usual routine of reading morning newspaper.\n\nAs i was about to start reading the newspaper. My eyes are closed with soft little fingers; I quickly realised it was of my beautiful kid.\n“Very Good Morning my dear”\n“Good Morning Papaaaa & Many Happy Returns of the day!!!” said my kid with so much excitement filled in eyes.\nLife teaches us a lot. Specially, when our kids enter into our life it marks a special & tectonic shift in our priorities upon them. Be it how much they grow, they remain as our kids forever. One of the shifts is that we tend to forget our own birthdays.\n\n“Thank you a lot, my love.”\n\n“Enjoy the day Papa. Will be back in couple of hours, got to attend a conference call.”\n\nAnd I’m back to my usual routine for the day.\n\nNow it is 7:20 A.M.\n\nMy wife isn’t in town due to unavoidable circumstances; this resulted in completing three non-fiction books in three straight days. Today for a change i’m inclined to watch a movie series on NetFlix. No Sooner I got engrossed in Elementary Series for about 4 hours.\n\nNow it is 12 NOON.\n\nI’m completely famished; with the available bechamel sauce in the refrigerator and fusilli in the container;  i started preparing my favourite pasta which i learned from my Italian friend Andrea.  Lunch is prepared in no time.\n\nI’m yet to start as I’m expecting my child to be in dining room by this time. But it didn’t happened. I’m perplexed as i never had such a lengthy conference call in my entire career,  and wondered how come this young kid got one. With this curious mindset i started climbing the stairs and knocked his home office room. { This generation kids has no difference between home and office }. My kid opened the door and sat on the table.\n\nAt first i thought meeting is going on; but it took me little time to recognise that my kid is just staring at the computer. My old age concluded that the kid looks baffled.\n\nWhat happened dear!!! You look so confused!! Can I be of your help?“\n\n”Thanks a lot Papa. for so long in my life i have been bothering you for small and little things. I felt that, if I could not handle this situation you may feel low on me about my capability.”\n\n“Remember Beta. Papa will never feel low about you. Papa only takes care about your long term happiness”, I kissed on forehead and continued, “If I can be of your help. Can you explain me your situation”.\n\n“Due to my poor communication and rapport with one of the most important client; my company was on the verge of loosing a quarter million dollar project. However, my boss saved me and the client has decided to go with our company with a string attached that I should not be the SPOC for the project. This morning my boss gave me a strong warning about my assertive behaviour and told to be humble toward my clients”\n\nKid paused for a while and continued, “For last few years I’m only successful with my assertive behaviour which helped the company to get many valuable projects. How come my boss conclude about me with one such incident!”\n\nI smiled and said in a slow yet in strong voice, “Are you worried about your bosses comment or about your clients remark to your boss?”\n\n“Both”\n\n“If I tell you to choose only one and work on it; such that the other one will evade; which one do you prefer to choose?”\n\n“Of-course, i will worry about my clients comment as it might impact my future career. But he is one of the many clients that I handled.”\n\n“You are on right track for half of it. But remember that he is the most important client”.\n\n“Agree Papa. Do you expect me to be more humble? I have to be assertive to convince the customer about the product. Both humble and assertive cannot go hand-in-hand as i look at it.”\n\n“Okie. Assume that you are right Beta. But on this special case it negates your fundamental thought process because of the incident that your experienced at your work place. Can you help me to download your definition of humble for me.”\n\n“As per my understanding. It is lowering ones own self esteem; which of-course i cannot do it.”\n\n“Are you sure about the definition.”\n\n“Yes Papa. This is what the google says”\n\n“Let us assume that you are right. What happens to you if you behave humble”.\n\n“Dad!!! I already told you”\n\n“Okie. Okie. I got it. Let me reframe such that i can get my answer. Does humble places you one step below your client and assertiveness on one step above?”\n\n“I never said it like that papa”\n\n“Don’t lie to me beta. Just now you have said that humble means lowering your self esteem. Assume that if it is true. What happens to you if you behave in such a way.”\n\n“Then….may be as i don’t like to behave in such a way and I might force that particular behaviour on me. Which may lead to self punishing and impacting my confidence and self respect.”\n\n“Great and Lovely answer my kid. To start with; let us take your last sentences that you mentioned - Humble is self punishing & leads to loose confidence and self respect”\n\nI paused for a second, to see how my kid is reacting on this. Kid seems to be curious about my further statements.\n\nSo I continued, “Is it not near to Self Humiliation. As i look at it my dear, English is a very beautiful language. Every feeling has a different word and different context.”\n\nAnd to further make my point i continued, “On the other side, you might be assuming that being assertive places a higher importance-weightage on your side. If you speak as if you are more important, people will assume that you are arrogant”\n\nKid interrupted suddenly and said, “I would agree to your point on self humiliation but certainly not on Assertiveness & Arrogance. As assertive is being confident and arrogance is assuming that i know better than the other.”\n\n“You are perfectly right my dear child. If you are assertive and not treating other person as equal as you. Then the other person assume that you are showing off your knowledge and superiority. And it is their right to assume.”\n\nAs my kid didn’t interrupted i continued again, “Usually the side effects of self humiliation and arrogance is the same; we try to become more resistance from inside to protect our identity. During the phase of self-humiliation we tend to become resistant to uplift our image. While for the other we tend to become resistant to prove our point strongly. On the contrary, Humble & Assertiveness doesn’t lead to a resistant behaviour.”\n\n“Dad. This is beautiful to listen. Is it practically possible to be the both.???”\n\nI smiled and said,“All I’m saying is to treat the other person as equal as you, which is a better meaning for humble, and speak confidently about the point you want to convince. As i look it, convincing is about listening, understanding and sharing about a particular thing on which you are confident and interested.”\n\n“Thanks a lot Dad. Few of them would have gone over my head. But I’m carrying a message that I have to humble & assertive towards my clients which solves both the party needs.”\n\n“Lovely my child. I’m famished. Lets finish our lunch and rush for any movie. Let us enjoy the life buddy”."

    "text": "Diwali or Deepavali is a popular Indian Festival where-in every kid within us awaits for the moment to burst the evening crackers. 😁 As per the Indian Culture, it is also  associated with the phrase - “ TAMASO MAA JYOTHIR GAMAYAA ”\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso, Ref: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pavamana_Mantra\nEvery human being, usually assumes knowledge to be bound & limited within the ambit of their experience & comprehension capability. Earlier as well we have discussed in earlier blogs that there are many unknown unknowns. \nThe only education that can lead us to more truer nature of ourselves is the spiritual education. Which is  the prime reason for considering spiritual education as primary education during olden days in Indian Culture.\nNonetheless, Any Education learnt from heart is a great spiritual experiential education.\nAlso, in the business world & real world there are well defined frameworks and algorithms which keep on evolving and changing. { Change is always constant }\n\n\n\n\n\nToday on this special occasion; I would like to recollect the learnings of Blue Ocean Strategy Book, where the authors clearly mention about the red ocean { Where there is already of excess competition and we limit our thinking to that Space and apply the frameworks & algorithms } and suggest to explore the blue ocean. While I was reading that book it made me to shatter my existing beliefs and learning and made me to impart new learnings and methodologies.\nLike this there are numerous books that help each one of us to expand our horizons of thinking and improves our comprehension capability. \nTo Conclude, Take Aside some time to Shutdown Social Media and pick a book that can curse the darkness of our ignorance.\n\nWish you all a Happy Diwali 2020.\n\nNote: Learnings and experiences that come from few people is an amalgamation of several books which should never be ignored as well."

    "text": "Continuing from previous blogs:\nWe have observed where the Rishi who gets enlightened through self inquiry with a true inherent desire to meet the Showman; they would like to come forward to share the similar experience to his few selected disciples; and thus ‘the Rishi’ becomes ‘the Guru’.  Who have created a way for each and everyone of us (In terms of Personal God) to get us liberated and realize the Showman within ourselves. And then we learnt that people who embark a travel to meet the showman are termed as ‘Brahmacharya’; To get motivated to meet the showman they start to pray the Sun who is more visible and tangible; and then continue their path for the ultimate showman.\nRishis Disciple is now in a confusion mode asking about the inner light dualities among the people and again got into confusion when he envisaged that his realization to showman has to be Sacrificed to realize him. His question of “why pooja” made him to realize that it should not be a ritual but a method to concentrate to realize the god. Whatever work we do, if we perform as per direction of showman we will attain peace and not thinking about the reward and living out of vicious loop of Gunas.\nWe left the previous blog with this question.\nShishya who is still unrest, ” Then it looks like pain is inevitable as most of us cannot realize the Showman ? ” asked Guruji; as his quench for knowledge is huge.\nAnd then Rishi/Guru responds in this way::\n” How does the pain start ? ”\n” Whenever we get hurt deeply, Guruji ”\n” I do perceive the unpleasant physical sensation when we get hurt physically. Is this what you are referring to ? ”\nShishya became flummoxed for a minute as he is unable to comprehend to what Guruji is referring to. However, he said ” Guruji, I’m referring to the mental pain and not the physical pain ”\n” What does it hurt internally ”\nShishya got peeved and said, ” It hurts me Guruji !!! ”\n” I understand that. However, i do know which part gets hurt when it is physical. How do i know what gets hurt when i’m suffering from mental pain ? ”\n” I feel it is heart. It gets heavier when i get hurt ”\n” Why does the heart gets hurt ?” asks Guruji without any procrastination.\n” It gets so because it got hurt. I’m sorry Guruji I don’t know where this conservation is leading to ? ” asked Shishya with a mixed of puzzled and annoyed facial expressions.\nGuruji smiled and said, ” Irony is that we don’t know what it gets hurt, but we get hurt. Isn’t it so interesting to know this “ \n” Then what is the reason that we experience so much pain ? “ \n” Our past gets into a big conflict with respect to the present or may be envisaged future. The magnitude of the conflict determines our pain. As we face many conflicts in our daily life we do face the varied range of pains and few may be worse. ” Guruji paused for a second and continued,\n” Also, we realize that the grey hair gets more endured to pain than younger ones because the more we face the pain the more we get endured to manage that particular conflict within ourselves ”\n” What is that conflict Guruji “,  asks Shishya enthusiastically now\n“  As I have said earlier, the conflict is with respect to our past. In other terms we can call it as a memory or the image that we stored in our brains. We usually identify more with respect to that memory or image, so consequentially we get into a conflict zone whenever a new information or data questions the identity of that image. Thus, resulting the so called mental pain ”\n” I do realize this Guruji, the moment I discover that that is a reaction of my past my nerves become calmer”\n” That true!!! Once we realize the cause of any pain. We cure it ” said Guruji as both of them were on the way to the river banks for evening strolls.\nAfter few moments, ” How can we get out of the conflict zone!! Guruji. “,  asks Shishya restlessly.\n— Answer in next blog\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nMy previous blogs for reference -\n\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/learnings-indian-culture/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning101/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning102/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning103/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning104/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning105/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning106/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning107/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning108/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning109/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning110/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning111/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning112/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning113/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning114/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning115/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning116/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning117/"

    "title": "COVID 19: THE CONCLUSION",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Note: This is my personal learning and quick summary of readings & learnings for last 100 days on various topics !!!\nHope the readers are liking the COVID19 blog series. However, my personal learning has helped me to debunk my old thoughts and helped me to create few fresh perspectives.\nOur Earlier Blogs:\n\nCOVID 19 : FACTS & REALTY CHECK - Where I learned about this pandemic - Published on 25th March 2020\nCOVID 19: NETIZEN REACTIONS - Where tried to show case few examples where netizens try to forward without a fact check. - Published on 29th March 2020\nCOVID 19: LESSONS FROM “IN” LAND - Our Learning from Kerala - Published on 5th April 2020.\nCOVID 19 : MEDICAL SCIENCE TO OVERCOME PANDEMIC - My Learning on the Corona Virus on Scientific Terminology. - Published on 15th of April 2020\nCOVID 19: DEATHS , LOCK DOWN & RECESSION - My Opine along with little research on inter relation about the same - Published on 28th of April 2020.\nCOVID 19: FEAR STRESS & SUICIDE - My Opine to high light on the stress and suicide in India SubContinent - Published on 10th of May 2020\nCOVID 19 : TREND, FORECAST & WHEN IT ENDS!!!! - My Small Research with the available data; On Daily basis the relevant charts will be available at https://rpubs.com/arun0710/COVID19 - Published on 6th June 2020\n\n________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nWhile i have been writing the above blogs; One thing that became very clear i.e.; that there is a lot that science is as well not yet aware. Some proven today by the existing experimental design can be proved wrong tomorrow with a redesigned experimental design.\nThen I have arrived at this Figure-1 which we can term it as Knowledge Hierarchy. It looks like knowing the complete science or may be conquering it; is extremely impossible or foolish journey.\n\n\n\nFig1: Knowledge Hierarchy; The Pyramid indicates the Dynamic Real World.\n\n\nThen how does one gain the depth of each subject and understand the reality. As we know science works by evidence. Gathering New Evidences may change the understanding the reality; i.e.; either we moves towards or moves away from reality.\nCapability of gathering new evidences becomes much more richer when there is right experience in that specific field. So, I inverted the pyramid to understand the depth of knowledge i.e.; Fig2. \nI have drawn two inferences from this \n\nTo know more depth - I should have vertical experience rather than horizontal experience.\nTo know more depth - I should visualize what science doesn’t know and draw inferences. \n\nWhich means to know more depth we should be capable of experiencing of what we are trying to visualize. Which can be termed as Experiential Learning as opposed to Evidence Based Learning.\n\n\n\nFig2: Inverted Knowledge Hierarchy. To Understand the Depth of Knowledge.\n\n\nMost interesting fact is that we think we are living alone and we feel to claim that we are in control of our well being. However, the real evidence now shows that out of 100 trillion human cells only 10% are real human cells and balance 90% belongs to microbes. In fact these 90 trillion microbes helps in regulating and maintaining our health. Thats a lot to take care about us involuntarily isn’t it so? Next time we can always say that we are never living alone!!! :). Also, are we giving required food to the 90 trillion microbes who are helping us to stay live?\nThis is as well a very interesting revelation for me as we don’t know who is helping us as we live in. We should be thankful to the nature for creating such a right balance.\nAlso, this reminded me of my earlier blog which was luckily in same lines about success { Can we claim Success?}\nThe reality is that complexity inside the human body is seldom studied as we only look for evidences outside us rather than looking inside/within us. \nFinal Conclusion or Personal Inferences for the 7-Blog Series of COVID 19 for Organic way of  Healthy Living:\nWhen we start looking inward - we start respecting the nature and the people who has laid the foundation so far to live in the comforts that we are enjoying or using them.\n\nBelieve in experience even when there is lack of evidence as it comes out from their experiential learning for years or generations. There should be some good to carry forward to our generations. Certainly I feel we can learn few things from our grand fathers.\nAlbeit the evidence based science is improving around us when we start looking inwards we will understand that we need to help ourselves more.\n\nAlarm: When we look inwards the answers seems to be simple. May be our logical brain will not be satisfied with simplicity so we may complicate it.\nTo live a health life may be one need to have a balance ph food and water with good sleep{ Picking excerpts from my elders }\n\nDrink water which is close to nature. And of-course drink it slowly .May the Municipal Tap Water TDS is sufficient. RO water is ideally designed for industrial purposes or for people who have inaccessible to pure & clean water.\n\n\n\nEat Slowly with balanced nutritious food. If possible cook in an unglazed clay pot such that 100% of the food nutrients are intact with the food when we are eating.\n\n\n\nSleep during the night time with all lights shutdown. { Melatonin is a hormone that gets generated only during dark which will regulated our moods & immune system as well }\n\n\n\nBreathe Slowly for 5 minutes at least 5 times in a day. Especially in the morning when trees starts releasing its morning cycle of oxygen. { Oxygen is the key component of our healthy living }\n\n\n\n36 hours fasting on every month of Ekadasi day is very helpful to reset our entire body system. { Also, called as Autophagy }\n\n\n\nSunLight is the Ultimate Nutrient.\n\n\n\nLiving with Nature will not only help us but as well the nature. Thus, we will be contributing to a resilient environment instead of practicing sustainable practices.\nLast but not the least maintain your thickest and closest families and friends and nurture the relationships. This will help in maintaining the body hormone level to optimum as well.\n\n\n\nI was so happy to write this conclusion as “Experiential Learning” is the roots of Indian Culture but lost its comprehension upon generations for last few hundred years. Hope, soon “Experiential Learning” become a part of our life as well.\nI took time to practice and experience some of these above mentioned practices for the last 15 days and results seems good for me.\nJAI HIND.\nAppendix-1: On the Contrary, How Humans are making more Pandemics:"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Just after reading few pages from Introductory Essay from S. RadhaKrishnan writings on “The Bhagavadgita”; felt like writing this blog piece.\nContinuing from my previous blog - https://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/learnings-indian-culture/\n\n\n\n\n\nThere has been always a strange question in my mind why would rishis or munis has to abandon their homes and move to Himalayas. This is like living an extreme Introvert life. Anyone of you who has watched “Into the Wild” movie (Which is the real story of Chris McCandless)  can relate to what i was referring to.\nIn the previous blog we have seen the example as how we view the world and we are left with an unanswered question i.e.;  “But who is running the show?”\nTo know who is that showman, one has to reduces the disturbances around him that obscures him to see him. If we are at home, it becomes a transcendental concept as we will be in constant pull and pushes with the environment around us.\nSo, the rishis would have started a journey to find a place where they could be all alone and as well as avoid any kind of external environmental interferences; And then yureka!!!! they would had finally found their place probably the Himalayas or the Enlightenment Tree.\nAs a process, In that specific place they would be in a constant pursuit of that single goal through self inquiry with or without aid of guru. \nThis Practice of Self Inquiry is called as “Jnana Yoga” { Which i have learnt while writing this blog piece}.  It is named so because; the human who is Ajnana would become Jnana only through the means of Self Inquiry.\nP.S.\n1) However, the Introvert Travel seems to have lost in its translation and led to miscomprehension and obscuring us from understanding of our own cultural Shrutis.\n2) Chris McCandless didn’t do any Self Inquiry; But he wants to live all alone and prove to the world that one can live in the wild without any external human dependency.\n3) Rishis on the other side through Jnana Yoga has learnt the learnings of dependencies."

    "title": "Depth & Breadth of MultiTasking",
    "section": "",
    "text": "One and half year ago I came across these two books which helped me to improve and change my thinking on multi-tasking.\nThe first question that came to me at that time is to Why i have to do multi-tasking? The usual meaning of Multi-Tasking is performance of multiple tasks at one time.\nMay I’m inclined to do multiple tasks in the following scenarios: 1) When-ever there is dearth of time and deadlines squeeze in. 2) If I’m good at one thing. 3) At times for no reason I like to multi tasking. As it gives a kick at the end of achievement. 4) When-ever I’m having food.\nIf we google down with right phrase questions we will get the right answers.\n\nLet me paste my answers here:\nFor Question-1: The answer is about time management\n\nFor Question-2: In Generally it is a myth to assume we are good at one thing and do two activities at same time { Ideally we cannot do two activities at the same. We switch the activities }. So, perform the activities when you think the activity which is been undergoing does not require cognitive attention.\n\nFor Question-3: Aaah. This is called so called fashion word - Instant Gratification. And may be this cult. But does that make worse or happy or some thing. See a quick video from Ellen.\n\nFor Question-4: I tend to watch TV or browse something else while eating food. Because I always assumed that having food is the least cognitive function involved. Do you think as well like me and here is the answer.\n\n\nThen what is depth & breadth of Multi Tasking: It comes from Focussed thinking and diffuse thinking. Watch this video\n\nWe may argue by saying that Diffuse Thinking is same as Multi Tasking?? Categorically Diffuse thinking and Multi Tasking are complete different. While Multi Tasking is doing multi things. Diffuse Thinking is create a thought process by connecting various things to get a larger picture. That’s the reasons most of the inventions didn’t happen in the lab area in earlier times it happened else where { i.e.; while driving, bathing , exercising etc.; }.\n\nTo Conclude: Watch this video which is a better conclusion than what i thought to write.\n\n                                HAPPY DIWALI with NEW HABIT FORMATION"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Continuing from previous blogs:\nWe have observed where the Rishi who gets enlightened through self inquiry with a true inherent desire to meet the Showman; they would like to come forward to share the similar experience to his few selected disciples; and thus ‘the Rishi’ becomes ‘the Guru’.  Who have created a way for each and everyone of us (In terms of Personal God) to get us liberated and realize the Showman within ourselves. And then we learnt that people who embark a travel to meet the showman are termed as ‘Brahmacharya’; To get motivated to meet the showman they start to pray the Sun who is more visible and tangible; and then continue their path for the ultimate showman.\nRishis Disciple is now in a confusion mode asking about the inner light dualities among the people and again got into confusion when he envisaged that his realization to showman has to be Sacrificed to realize him. His question of “why pooja” made him to realize that it should not be a ritual but a method to concentrate to realize the god. Whatever work we do, if we perform as per direction of showman we will attain peace and not thinking about the reward and living out of vicious loop of Gunas.\nNow Shishya is trying to learn about the pains and its conflicts. And has learnt that the conflict is his past image with respect to the present. Also, the conflict will be no more only when one tries to understand the conflict. Finally, leading him to realize that it is his duty to come above his own conflict and understand the truth. Further, trying to learn the process of being with the truth for-ever.\nWe left the previous blog with this question.\nAfter a while, for a change, Guruji asks, ” Since you understood the process of attaining Truth. Can you describe the process ?”\nAnd then Rishi/Guru & Shishya Dicusses in this way:\n”  Guruji, you have mentioned that the methods have to be different to attain truth. So one has to discover their methods.”\n” Aren’t methods and process is same? ”\n” How can it be Guruji? You have mentioned earlier that (link) methods are tools to realize showman. But they became mere rituals “, answered Shishya with a calmer voice.\n” Methods got turned into rituals such that the process stays longer, but the process has lost its soul in due course”\nShishya looks deeper into his thought process by closing his eyes and nods his head.\n”  Guruji, these methods, of course, are created to realize the showman with-in, i.e., Atman. ”\nGuruji nodded his head happily and said, ” Elaborate.”\n” When you pray to a personal god, it means you are trying to speak to your showman. So also, when we do ‘Abhishekam’ with milk or water, we try to cleanse the soul and get closer to our showman. So to infer, every method is devised as a relentless effort to realize the showman with-in.”\nGuruji felt satisfied by his responses and said, ” Then what is the process? ”\n” Guruji, there is no process. We created the rules, but the actual process is to be with the showman in any activity we perform. ”\nGuruji hinted to Shishya, ” In any activity that we perform? Right now, we are talking. Can this be as well ? ”\nShishya smiled and responded, ” Speaking to others and not to be confused with responding to others is an activity. In which we speak to a reflection of our showman with others. And whatever they speak is the real Naivedyam ( link ) to our showman itself.”\nAnd Shishya continued with an enlightenment aura, ” Actually, all living beings and this entire universe are the reflections of our supreme showman. We are just a tiny part of the supreme showman. Understanding this Oneness of showman among all of us is the actual process of staying with showman forever.”\nGuruji opened his eyes happily and said, ” Shabhash Shishya, now you are a truly enlightened person. You don’t need any other Guru. You are Guru by yourself”. Saying this, Guruji packed his bag and left the ashram on a happy note. \n                                                                  — End of Guru Shishya Story —\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nMy previous blogs for reference -\n\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/learnings-indian-culture/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning101/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning102/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning103/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning104/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning105/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning106/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning107/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning108/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning109/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning110/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning111/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning112/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning113/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning114/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning115/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning116/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning117/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning118/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning119/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning120/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning121/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning122/"

    "text": "Let us time travel in our thought process to one the first known ancient civilizations i.e.; Çatalhöyük. { I’m excluding the Harappan Civilisation which in recent times made the news to be the longest and ancient civilizations of all time (almost near to “Göbekli_Tepe”. As still sufficient information is yet to be available for more study. }\nÇatalhöyük is believed to be the first town in the history and as well believed to be the first known egalitarian society. It existed approximately at about  7,500 BCE. It seems that upto10,000 people used to lived in Catalhoyuk, which was about 1% of the global population at that time. It survived for 2,000 years which is of-course huge time.\n\nÇatalhöyük is believed to be the first town in the history and as well believed to be the first known egalitarian society. It existed approximately at about  7,500 BCE.

It survived for 2,000 years which is of-course huge time.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is more interesting to me is that \n\nAgriculture: “they also grew peas, almonds and pistachios, reared sheep and cattle, and gathered fruits from the forests. Hunting is as well the main source for food”. ”\nInfrastructure: The tightly packed “city”was made of simple mud-brick rooms that seemed to have been added on again and again as the community grew and changed across the centuries of habitation”.\nReligion: “The stately goddess seated on a throne flanked by two lionesses  was found in a grain bin, which suggests might have been a means of ensuring the harvest or protecting the food supply.In later cultures, similar depictions are seen of Cybele, a mountain goddess.”\nMining: “here is also evidence that the settlement was the first place in the world to mine and smelt metal in the form of lead”.\n\nEverything is almost there that is needed for a life to live in peace, harmony & prosperity.\nBeing an egalitarian society & no hierarchy in the society ; Çatalhöyük can as well be the first  Anarcho-communism state. Irony, is that people at that time aren’t aware of this term. They seems to live an uncomplicated life of having & cultivating good food; living in neat society and places; living together as a team.\nNow-a-days, we are having tough time to get along with teams even for one full day due to our over dependence on non-living things. Then how come a civilisation stayed as a team for approx. 7,30,000 days. Harmony would have lost among the society if few of them questioned to themselves W.I.F.M. Not our mistake but now our society has become fragmented and highly hierarchal (especially in last 200 years) which makes us to question ourselves W.I.F.M. \nHowever, during this span of 9000 years what seems to we have lost is that understanding and living a life - don’t think about result this creates tension in your mind give your full effort sincerely this gives the result which you deserve. This is difficult to practice But this is best practice in life.once you know the greatness of this quality, practice it everything comes for you. \nIt looks like the Çatalhöyük Soceity has followed the same for 7,30,000 days as also has strong faith on Kartha, Karma & Kriya Process which allowed them to work as a team.\n\nKARTA = Performer. \nKRIYA = Method/Implementation. \nKARMA = Consequences.\n\nW.I.F.M may be good for short term survival. However, if those ancestors and our ancestors would have thought on those same lines we would not be such a privileged society with all the basic comforts.\nTo conclude, KRIYA is the only thing that is in our hands that helps to work in positive direction to do value addition for the betterment for the future and existing society."

    "text": "This post was supposed to be written as on Apr 2013 in the blog www.arunviews.com { which is currently not available } based on certain events that took in my life till that time. Hope it is not too late to write & publish an old thought.\nThis blog is written on non linear and disengaged screenplay without a conclusion for a purpose; In this post I will be sharing few personal events as well as some fictional; and certainly not to portray a CnC. Hope you will like it.\nBack then I was leading a delivery and configuration team { It is prior to current Scrum Master teams in IT Sector } along with couple of girls where-in the role involves a lot of responsibility on delivery quality. So the Noblesse oblige has became a defacto. After a successful year with the team; one of my team member is struggling to cope up with the speed of the delivery as well as to co-exist along with the other stakeholder team members. Upon asking the reason she replied, “Bhai! aap ke jaise thoda power and control hona chahiye merko bhi”. I tried to convince her but she was reluctant and i took the responsibility; and slowly and luckily I moved away from that project to other project as she understood my commitment and responsibility for power.\nLater after a month of settling down in the new place and project; I pondered did i display the same behaviour on how she perceived me and tried to correlate between love and power.\nCame across some summaries of book at that time - Love & Power : A Theory and practice of social change. But didn’t bought the book due to spendings at that time. Related video - Youtube\nAuthors Ted-Ex Video\n\nAnd very recently i came across this link in Psychology Today - Link\nFew months later in search for this answer i learnt that love and sex are related in personal life. Then i rolled a questionnaire survey inside my working group whether they had best experience in first love or in first night. 75% of them replied that it is later and balance replied in combination. Then i realised that there is indeed a process for love which was an interesting revelation.\nWhich lead to me to this link - How love works - link.\n” ‘And she is not growing’ was an interesting revelation in this movie; Isn’t it.”\n\n“It involves lots of love and confidence upon his thinking process which made him realise,” replied Madhu.\n\n“Hope it is not a double entendre reply” asked Sanjay with a doubt.\n\n“Of course it is!!!”, replied madhu with a smile and continued, “it is been 3 months you cannot even shout in this theatre and say it to your friends that we are in love”\n\n“Madhu, please give me some time!!!”\n\n———————————————————————————————————————————\n“This is your fifth consecutive love failure and yet you are after an another one. This is not called as love. It is lust or much worser than it” replied Vivek in anguish to Rahul in their fifth tequila round in a bar and restaurant at round 11 past in night.\n\n“My friend!!! Rahul defines the relationship as directly proportional to either of their intimacies shared and inversely proportional to the square of the misunderstandings”\n\n“Oh my goodness. My dear friend let us move it is almost midnight”.\n\nAs they are walking to the parking lot; Rahul suddenly shouted like a drunken master - “Friend!! i think you are not convinced by my earlier logic. Let me explain my new thought process. Assume there are 10 balls of equal size in an empty space they tend to be in that space in balance for ever. Assume these balls are like emotions towards our friends, family and etc.; Now what happens when we remove one ball from this balance structure. Ideally the rest of the balls adjust their position themselves to get into a balance. Personally, It is difficult and wrong for my family to get affected due to them so I replace the ball to be in composure. I hope you will understand me”\n\n“Yeh bhakwas ne kuch bhi bolke convince karlega”\n\n———————————————————————————————————————————\nDuring my classes at GLIM I came across the concept called as leader follower relationship. Usually in academics the topic is limited to politicians and organisation. I felt it can be applied the same to any two individuals then I approached the professor and asked - “Sir, I feel that husband and wife can also be like a leader and follower where in the the roles can be exchange between them at different times. Am I right?”\n\n“You are absolutely right Arun, I’m happy that you are listening to my classes. But do participate in class participation as well; as it involves marks for your final grade”\n\n“Sure Sir”\n\nand then we spoke for some time and in the end he told..\n\n“Important thing in leader follower relationship is when to be a leader and when to be a follower.”\nand continued, “Leader tries to create a balance between what he knows versus what he is. Whenever there is an imbalance he becomes a follower to create a balance”\n\n“Hope you will understand about it before the term ends”\n\nBut in reality i didn’t understand it even after i received degree from the college.\n\n———————————————————————————————————————————\nEeswar in frustration of love failure booked a call-girl for a night and below is the conversation between them.\n\nLady: What kind of experience do you want. Like GF Experience, Dinner Experience etc.;\nEeswar: Let us live in reality and have the current experience in the real roles.\nLady: Sure Sir.\nEeswar: I have a personal question before we begin with our session. Can I ask?\nLady: I’m all yours Eeswar. You can ask me anything.\nEeswar: You meet many people in a day or month. How can you ensure for unique experience with all of them.\nLady: I cannot ensure for the experience. But I ensure that my behaviour is consistent with all of them. If they treat us better their experience may get multiplied.\nEeswar: If they are not good looking. Do you ensure that your behaviour is consistent.\nLady laughed and replied - “India mein intha population kaisa hoga ji. Ab tho light bandh karenge”\n\nand then they enjoyed.\n\n———————————————————————————————————————————\nTo Conclude - Are Power, Love and Sex are Independent variables or Interrelated variables or their Interaction causes something else?"

    "text": "We usually solve many conflicts that arise outside us; but we usually submit ourselves to the conflict within us. \nLet us enjoy the story of Balu who overcame his own internal conflict.\n\nBalu is a happy going kid who wants to be happy and make the surroundings happy. However, he has his own short comings of being short tempered when things are not going in the right direction as per his thought process. A moment in his life.\nScenario: Balu is in his third year of engineering and by gods grace he is gifted with a beautiful girl friend, Anuhya. Being month of November, he had fixed a date today with Anuhya at a popular 4 star restaurant in the town for candle little dinner.\nTime is 3:30 P.M. { 15th of Nov }\nBalu said to himself, ” It is a tiring day!!! My brain got overloaded with more new stuff to digest. Let me hit bed some time.” Being a studious person as well he set-up an alarm for 4:00 P.M. in his Nokia 105 series feature phone.\nAt about the same time, when he is about to slip into deep sleep. He got a phone form an unknown number. He ignored for the first time. But it rang again.\nWith much hesitation, he picked his mobile and said, “Hi, This is Balu. Can I know who is this”\n“Hey!!! it’s me.” said a sweet voice and her excitement can be felt by her tone.\n“I’m sorry. I couldn’t recollect you ma’am. Can you help me out please”\n“Darling!!! It’s me your Sahasra!!! You forgot my voice.”\nBalus’ eyes got wide opened as if some one slapped on his cheek.\n“Darling!!! where are you! As was in deep sleep i didn’t paid attention to your voice” He replied both with excitement & confusion.\n“I’m at your college tower. I would like to meet you in person. Is that possible for you now please!!!”\nBeing more perplexed, he responds calm and cool voice, ” Try to guide yourself to the Trishna SuperMarket outside our campus. Will meet you in 10 minutes.”\nHigh & Intensely confused Balu got dressed to his best and started walking to the super market. However, his mind got traversed four years back when he first met Sahasra in his Plus 1. They have been together for almost one and half year; before they broke up on petty issues. It’s been 2 years since they met face to face. \nBeing an odd time for anyone to see outside. He could spot a girl draped herself in pink coloured saree. Suddenly his vision started to become blurred as his eyes turned misty. He realised that the relative distance between them closing as a faster face than supposed to be. And then a sound “thudd” has generated when their bodies got touched against each other and it remained in that position for a minute.\nThe girl took the initiative to break the body lock and moved to another lock with her lips and show cased her long lost intimacy. Balu being on the receiving end doesn’t have any clue; however, his eyes responded by turning from misty to watery and then rolled on his checks and then to her neck.\n“Sahasra!!! How on earth are you here!!! It is unimaginable and unbelievable!!!” Balu spoke with affection. \n“Darling!!! Your Social Pages has every thing about you. However, i had to travel 120 KM by road to speak to you in person than over mobile”, she spoke with a sense of satisfaction and accomplishment.\n“I love you baby”, saying this Balu gave another kiss to her, ” How do you react if i would say i’m already committed with another babe in this college?”\n“It is none of my business what has happened in this duration. But now i need you for rest of my life!!!” She replied on a defensive note but with a smile.\nAnd then she continued, ” Are u really committed ? Are you kidding me ?”\nBalu was unprepared to this question and then he lied by saying, ” Of Course NO!!!. Love never dies but my current focus is on my studies and placement.”\nSahasra’s expression looks relieved and her face glowed like an Olympic Lantern, ” I know my Balu. He may commit mistakes but not at the cost of my-stakes”\nHe hugged her as a response to her dialogue and then said, “Darling!!! Let me get you something from the Super Market and then we will go out for some time. Hope that is in your plan today?”\n“Yes. Yes. I’m all yours”\nBalu quickly slid into the supermarket and while shopping for Little Hearts & Dairy Milk he called Anuhya and spoke, ” Babe!!! A childhood friend of mine has visited the town for a paper presentation in another college. We might need to cancel our outing today. Sorry for this Babe.”\nAnuhya replied casually,” Babe!!!  It is fine. Our last outing was just a week ago. It should be fine. Be safe and drink less.”\n“Thanks a lot Anu. Love you”\n“Love you too Babe. Let us catch tomorrow morning at the Learning Centre” \nBalu with a relieved mind came out of the super market and shared the biscuits and chocolate with her and then they departed slowly by walking on the side of the road till they found a commute to the downtown.\nWhile they were in the cab, Sahasra asked, ” Did you ever thought to make our relationship to fusion again during this duration ?”\nBalu responded in anger, ” I think you know the answer and how much i had tried at that time. Let’s not dig the past Sahasra.”\nSahasra smiled and moved closer to him and leaned her head on his left shoulder and said, ” Sorry Darling!!! I Love you to my life. I’m happy that you accepted me with open arms. My respect on you has moved to a higher level ”\nAt the same time he got a classic message beep of Nokia phone which read as “Miss you Babe” and he quickly replied as ” Mis u 2 Anu” { Like an army person } and changed the phone profile to silent mode.\nThey shopped till dusk in the downtown and then Balu took her to the same four star hotel for a candle light dinner. Balu and Sahasra enjoyed together to their best and to a third person it looks like they are “made for each other”.\nHe dropped Sahasra at her College Hostel and said, ” I have never been soo happy in my life. You should have come little early and we would had many more beautiful memories. I Love you a lot Saha!!!” And he hugged her tightly and gave a bidding liplock for the night.\nTime is 11:30 P.M. { 15th of Nov }\nBalu is exhausted, exalted & distracted; In such a state he boarded the bus which might take three hours to reach his destination. He gone to the last row of the bus and slept on it like as if it is an Indian railway berth. At about the same time, he received two beeps to his mobile from either of his girl friends which read as ” Can we speak now ?“. In reply he said,” I’m too tired Love. Let us talk tomorrow.” And then he slept off.\nTime is 6:30 A.M. { 16th to Nov }\nBalu doesn’t have clue how he reached to his hostel after he slept in the bus. He got quickly refreshed and reached to the Learning Centre to meet Anu.\nHe continued with this complicated parallel love format for almost 15 days. During this 15 days his confidence and self esteem has plummeted to the lowest level; which left him with no other choice but to reach out to his saviour senior sister,  Pravallika. ” Akka, need your help ; can we meet now”\nThey met over for dinner in the college campus restaurant and Balu explained his current situation to Pravallika while they were having Manchow Soup.\nShe smiled and replied, ” What do you want??”\nBalu Passionately replied, ” I want both of them. If god has given that option I would choose it.”\nShe again laughed and replied, ” You aren’t a God or a Movie Hero to have that option. I’m still unable to understand how come you are loving two girls with same amount of passion. It is still a riddle for me. ”\n“Me too. I don’t have any clue to what am i doing Akka.” and continued in Telugu, “ Preminchadam Goppa Kadhu.  Preminchabadam Goppa Antaru. Kani Iddari tho Preminchabadam Narakam Akka. Naramkam”.  { It Means - There is a saying Sister that  loving someone is not great achievement but receiving Love from other is the greatest achievement for a human. However, receiving Love from both of them is a Hell. It is Hell. } and continued,” I’m angry with myself Akka”. He said these words with sharp tone and intense passion.\n” You may think you are in a fancy state of world. But in reality you are in a state of deep shit.”\nMain Course along with starter has came to the table. Waiter was about to server the food on the plates for which Balu has gestured that we will help ourselves.\nPravallika took a bite of Chicken Lollipop and continued, ” Balu, there might be many ways to address to your situation, i would like to give you two extreme solutions to you:\n\nSolution1: Finalize the girl with whom you can live for life long. May be do a SWOT analysis of their qualities or any other things of your interest. Choose the one and Dump the other.\nSolution2: Assume that I’m one among those girls and assume that this situation is happening to me currently. What would you do?\n\nYou may deserve both of them. Out of them who deserves you the most is it either of them, both of them or …. ”\nBalu got further distracted; however, understood the underlying message of Pravallika. \nShe moved to the main course and continued, ” Remember in four months time you have to sit for placements. Also, you cannot keep everyone happy at the same time. You might need to take care of the larger happiness of life & career. ”\nSoon they finished the dinner in Silence and departed quickly.\nNext two days Balu has been thinking deeply as if it is a life changing decision and then in the next 15 days he conveyed to either of them that he is in love the other girl and would like to have a breakup on their status quo. It was tough to manage varied emotions of three persons, being a lead in this blog he made it.\nOn Dec 31st, he met Pravallika at the same restaurant and said, ” Thanks a lot Sister, I’m more relieved now. I might emerge as a cheater for both of them. But it is good for them. Thanks a lot for guiding me and bringing this to the conclusion.”\n“It is fine Bro. is Thanks necessary???”\nBalu replied, “sahayam pondina vadu kruthagnatha chupaka povadam entha tappo sahayam chesina vadu kruthagnatha korukovadam kuda anthe tappu.”\n” Love this. You are learning your lessons. Happy New Year.”\n“Happy New Year :)”\n———————————————END OF UKNOWN CHAPTER OF BALU ———————————————\nHope you have enjoyed the story of Balu. Some times, we cannot provide the right conclusions for the Inner Conflict. It is always about to overcome them for a positive outlook of life.\nJAI HIND!!!"

I {Arun Koundinya} have been hearing and reading a lot about the “South Korean” Model and their use of Advance Analytics in quick identification of Corona positive cases at an early stage level.\nHowever, I’m also a believer that “For Indian Problems we might need Indian/Indigenous Solutions to start with; rather a copy cat solutions as the larger Mass user base are still Indians.”\nSo, I took the numbers as on 4th April 2020 Morning 9 AM and picked the states that has more than 200 Confirmed Cases. Then derived a metric ( Deaths upon Confirmed - Ideally it has to be ( Deaths + Critical ICU Cases ) / Confirmed )\nI followed some papers and articles on this particular metrics; As this will help us which states or countries are having best practices. Such that the same practices if possible can be implemented to other countries.\nMentioned 4 states contribute to 50% of the Corona Confirmed Cases in India. It is good that may be the testing is extensive in these regions.\nTamil-Nadu and Kerala StandOut among the others by having less number of deaths. Tamil Nadu reported its first case on 7th March 2020, may be it is too early to decide. While Kerala reported its first case on 30th Jan 2020 and still there are only two deaths.\nSo, I strongly felt that Kerala is doing some-what good and we should learn from them. So, I reached out to Dr. Mahesh and inquired about the control measures in Kerala and reason having less number of deaths in that place.\nHe explained about their Experience of NIPAH VIRUS during May and June 2018. Which is even more deadliest contagious disease than Corona having a fatality rate of 80%. However, Kerala has been successful in controlling the entire situation as a OUTBREAK without spreading it into an Epidemic one. { To Note: Nipah Virus has no Vaccination & No Treatment }\nI requested him to write a blog on the Kerala Effectiveness and their current methodologies and learnings which might be useful may be for us in the long term.\nMalayalam Movie “VIRUS” has been released in year 2019 based on true events happen during the outbreak in Kerala. It is on Amazon Prime you may watch at as well. {Link}. It has English Subtitles as well.\nIn India, Outbreak of Nipah Virus has took place in year 2001 in West Bengal.

    "text": "How Kerala became proactive with experience of handling NIPAH VIRUS and how it resulted in strategic response and mitigation during the current Corona Pandemic\nA Quick Video by Experts\n\nIf NIPAH had started in a country of large dense populations with cramped hospitals the outbreak would be far worse and probably resulting in more number of fatalities. We all are well aware what has happened on 2nd of May 2018 the first reported case happening in Kozhikode or Calicut district of Kerala . When the first case was reported the medical staff Was puzzled as to how the patient as to how to respond to the rapidly deteriorating state of the patient. The first reported case was of a 28 year old architect from Kerala’s Perambara town, he came in to the casualty of BABY MEMORIAL HOSPITAL, CALICUT with encephalitis(inflammation of brain tissue) like symptoms and a heart rate 180 beats per minute and his blood pressure had shot up. His limbs had no reflexes when examined by the neurologist.\nDr. Jayakrishnan who was examining him had started to rule out each disease that he might had in mind . But apparently he was thinking on the lines of Japanese encephalitis a mosquito borne infection which doesn’t affect more than one person of the same household but surprisingly the patients younger brother, had died about 12 days ago after showing similar symptoms. His father and aunt, too, had contracted the infection. \nThe neurologist was then suspicious about a rabies but it was ruled out too due to the absence of a common pet. Next the doctor was thinking in the lines of toxic poisoning but poisoning never has a fever. By then the team of neurologists had become alert that this could be an unseen virus which was not seen in Kerala before. The neurologist decided that he would consult with a virologist for further help. Govindakarnavar Arunkumar at Karnataka’s Manipal Centre for Virus Research (MCVR), about 300 km from Kozhikode. Patients samples were dispatched to MCVR and it was found out to be the deadly Nipah virus. { Note:MCVR team was trained by the United States’ Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to test for the Nipah virus }.\nThis made the Manipal laboratory only the second facility in India capable of doing so, apart from Pune’s National Institute of Virology (NIV). These are the labs which are currently functional in detecting and confirming positive cases of coronavirus . The good move of getting trained By CDC is helping us to further increase the number of labs and train various technicians in handling and sampling the testing.\n\n\n\nSo when did the Nipah virus actually begin to manifest and which country had it first?\nThe virus gets its name from a village in Malaysia-Sungai Nipah. This was the village where Nipah virus was first identified in 1998-1999.\nThere, the virus is believed to have jumped from fruit bats of the Pteropus species to domestic pigs tied under the trees where such bats breed. From the pigs, the virus travelled to pig breeders, infecting and killing about 105 of them in an outbreak. \nNipah next appeared in Bangladesh, triggering nearly 15 outbreaks in the 2000s. It mainly infected people who had a taste for raw palm sap, which is frequently contaminated by bat urine and saliva.\nOnce the virus spread to humans, it was transmitted from one person to another through respiratory droplets. Luckily, Nipah does not spread efficiently and moves only to people within a metre of very sick patients.\n\n\nHow does Nipah spread and how did it spread in Kerala?\nBat secretions laden with virus can infect people during fruit tree climbing, eating/handling contaminated fallen fruits or consuming raw date palm sap/juice or toddy,” says the National Centre for Disease Control in its guidelines on Nipah virus. \nThe guidelines outline that besides animal-to-human transmission, Nipah virus can also transmit between humans. The human-to-human transmission occurs when a healthy person has close contact with an infected person at home or during treatment at hospital Another possible source of infection can be bodies of people who died due to Nipah virus. \nThe National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) advises that handling of such dead bodies should be done strictly in accordance with government advisory.\nIn Kerala the Index Patient has passed the virus to 16 persons at Medical College Hospital; later two more were infected, increasing the total count of infected to 18. There were 10 deaths in the first week, including a nurse named Lini Puthussery who treated the index patient before diagnosis. The outbreak began in Kozhikode district and later spread to the adjoining Malappuram district.\n\n\n\nAn Short Article on Lini Puthussery\n\n\nHere is the first wave of patients from the index patient.\n\n\n\nContact tracing of Nipah Virus Patients\n\n\n\n\nWho had put their efforts in declaring Kerala NIPAH free? & Brisk State Response.\nThrough the Contact tracing immediately within a week approximately 1500 people were is observation and every couple of days there were monitored on various health parameters along with strict lockdown in the hot spot districts.\nThe entire process was followed to the letter as per WHO Protocol. {Be it be Fumigation, Usage of Disposable suits and Masks, Protective Gears for all Health Care Workers & Support Staff and Cremation of the bodies}.\nOfficially by June End 2018 Kerala was declared Nipah Free.\nIn a country where women rarely occupy high-profile public offices as much as the sea of men in white shirts, this former high school chemistry teacher and a first-time state health minister has won many hearts for being extremely approachable and caring. She is no stranger to handling a health crisis, having successfully led the fight against the Nipah virus outbreak in 2018 and 2019.  And she is none other than Shailaja Teacher.\nThere has been a demand for an efficient virology lab in Kerala since the Nipah virus outbreak in the state. Following this, the Virology Lab at Alappuzha was strengthened. The Institute of Advanced Virology Lab at Thiruvananthapuram is also functioning now. Tests against the new type of novel coronavirus could be run only with the permission of the Centre. The Institute of Advanced Virology Lab at Thiruvananthapuram is fully equipped and able to detect and prevent such infections very quickly.\n\n\nCorona Pandemic Effectiveness in Kerala Improvised Methodology\nWith expats from Kerala across the globe, her nearly 20-member team constantly follows the global coverage of corona. Whenever Shailaja gets time, she also looks upon the Internet and keeps herself updated, a trait she claims to have helped her save the customary briefing of the team of doctors under the team about corona.\nSome of the measures taken during the recent corona pandemic are the complete transparency between the government and public. She asked the media houses not to publish any data except from official sources which she would update through a press conference held everyday evening. This was done to prevent to widespread panic and to keep the public informed . She welcomes all of her staff with a empathic smile which brings in strength and solace which are effective in leading the staff. \nWhen a question from the press was asked as to how does she pull it off? “I don’t do anything special. I have a degree in chemistry so I have some knowledge about molecules and medicines. Otherwise, it is always a team effort,” said Shailaja.\nSome Measures undertaken in Kerala on a war-footing were as follows:\n\n24x7 call-centre at state coronavirus outbreak Control & Prevention Cell. Similar 24x7 call-centres across all 14 districts. Teams constitutes of trained Junior Health Inspectors, doctors & other.\nKerala State Control Room - The War Room - for all crucial information gathering/dissemination, multi-level co-ordination of all within the Health department. This is replicated in all 14 districts to streamline information flow and decision making.\nMonitoring of airports in Kerala had been strengthened. Those who have returned from China are advised to contact the respective District Medical Officer. It was decided to take special care of them if they displayed any symptoms. It was also directed to health department officials to take stringent measures to prevent the spread of the disease.\nThe Department of Health has released a set of guidelines and therapeutic standards approved by the World Health Organisation for strengthening the novel coronavirus resistance.\nManufacturing of Face Masks by Prisoners.\nEnsurity of supply and availability of Protective Gears for all Medical Staff and their support Staff.\n\nFollowing Brisk actions were taken by them in the month of March\n\nAnnounced a Rs 20,000 crore financial package to tide over the present crisis in the wake of the virus outbreak.The multi-crore special package includes Rs 500 crore health package, Rs 2,000 crore loans and free ration.\nSocial security pension of Rs 1,320 crore, given in April, would be distributed this month, he said, adding that 50 lakh people will benefit through the pension scheme.\nThose belonging to the below poverty line (BPL) and Anthyodaya, who don’t receive social security pension, would be given Rs 1,000 each, for which Rs 100 crore would be earmarked. Cutting across APL and BPL families, 10 kg of free ration would be distributed and Rs 100 crore would be set aside for the purpose, he said. even during the initial days of the outbreak, when people were encouraged to remain indoors, Kerala was the first state to announce free ration for the poor. Delhi and Telangana soon followed the suit.\nA string of 1,000 low-cost hotels, providing food at Rs 20, would be opened across the state next month, the chief minister added.\nLocal bodies have been asked to identify cooks and enumerate ward-level volunteers for home delivery of cooked food. Considering the plight of patients stuck in hospitals across the state, the CM said government hospital canteens will provide them and their families food\nThe Kerala government has announced that all migrant workers who have been officially called “guest workers” would be provided with accommodation and food. The government has also set up special helpline numbers to enable poorer households in want of food to contact the government\nThe volunteer teams called “Aarogya Sena” consisting of local youth were formed after Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan announced the decision. Separate WhatsApp groups were formed for each ward, adding the volunteer squad members, local politicians and village officials. Under the watch of the ward members, the team identified all financially struggling families. The contact details of the Sena members were shared with all residents of the locality so that they can contact them and order lunch for the next day.\nThe state also announced temporary housing and food facilities for transgenders in the state who often don’t have enough savings or social security benefits such as ration.\n\nTo Conclude,\n\nThere might be many best practices across the states. However, we picked Kerala because of the clarity of information they are disseminating on day to day basis. { Link }\nKerala CM is one of the first CMs who mentioned this tweet; which i liked it personally.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is a huge achievement for the state especially when COVID19 patients above the age of 60 are considered in the high risk category across globe. Here is the tweet from Shailaja Teacher.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdding on this, Kerala has been learning to become self sufficient from back to back blows of Nipah Virus and Kerala Floods\n\nOur Final Commentary:\n\nIndia being a high density population has to become self sufficient in handling and detecting the new variety of zoonotic viruses going forward. Also, this field might open few jobs in India.\nSupply and demand for job opportunities and future scope on Health Sector related fields has to be created on war footing post the country is free from Corona.\nEach State has to be self sufficient: May be the central government can send teams from different cities across India for disaster management to Kerala and train on these strategies for future preparedness. Also, while forming the national budget a disaster response budget is to be allocated to each state in India and distribute to them to take swift action.\nIt is good to take private sector help in approving new hospitals and increase the number of hospitals across India with facilities and mock drills to tackle epidemics.\n\nOther Informative Videos at User Disposal\n\nWhy to Bats Carry So Many Diseases?\n\nThe Story of Ebloa."

Once, he gets the experience of Showman; he shares the similar experience to his few selected disciples and thus ‘the Rishi’ becomes ‘the Guru’. { Person who experiences Showman becomes liberated and he is called as a Jivamukta i.e.; liberated being }\nGuru who is liberated remains to be a Guru and never claims to be a God. A well known Jivamukta of my Grandfathers time i.e.; Sri Ramana Maharshi who doesn’t have a temple but stresses on self-inquiry and meditation.\n\n\n\nSri Ramana Maharshi - Jivanmukta\n\n\nA Person who is capable of performing self-inquiry and has the will to get undisturbed have a chance to meet the Showman. How about the more common people like us who cannot disband the existing life but still want to experience the Showman.\nFor such people,  Bhakti Yoga {Bhakti Marga} comes handy to realize about the Showman by showcasing our love and devotion. \nAs a culture, it was not the “Hero Worship” but the Worship to realize our Hero in an intent to become liberated.\n{The Concept of Showman gets difficult to penetrate for most of us unless we internalize the concept; so for most of us the Showman in the form of a deity becomes comprehendible and easy to relate.}\nThus if we observe the temples and its’ pattern it looks almost the same i.e.; having a water pond and then the path way until we reach garbhagriha. Water Pond is a tradition where-in we are intended to reach the Deity why washing away our desires and leaving away our materials comforts outside the temple; walking with one mindset of god until we reach the garbhagriha and experience the god.\nThis Bhakti Marge became very popularised in India as Bhakti Movement. Every Historian has their own view on this movement; nonetheless it has created an opportunity for even the layman to experience the god in the form of deity on daily basis without disbanding their other attached personal life.\n\nIs it possible to realize the Showman with Intense & Pure Devotion:\nBhagvadgita mentions that the a person who is driven by pure love, knowing and seeking nothing beyond that experience of love Showman can get liberated.\nTallapaka Annamacharya -  whose devotion is unmatched for the love of Lord Venkateshwara which made him to write approximately 32,000 songs dedicated to him and for him.\n\nList of Annamacharyulu Songs - Link\nYou can imagine the love who has come up with 32000 Original Songs in his life time. Out of which few of them i.e.; even after 500 hundred years are still trending.\nOf-course he would be highly liberated in his time by singing for Showman by dedicating to Showman.\n\nA song which got viral - written by Annamacharya Garu { Crux about the Showman }\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________\nIgnorance worship usually leads to Hero Worship i.e.; outward worship rather than inward worship. We adopt (or) resort to outward worship who fulfils our desire which would lead to blind Hero Worship.\nUpanashids and Bhagvadgita clearly mentions for not to submission but for the development of inner spirit to gain the freedom. \nClearly our old texts are trying to explain and realize the experience of the god in a logical manner and not through enforcement."

Without their contribution it is very tough to assume our current position as a sole contributor.\nAlso, albeit in this commercial phase; i.e.; being our academic/professional places being more ROI driven, we still owe to at-least few gurus who shaped us as a better person.\nIn the last blog we have seen where Rishis has handpicked few of theirs’ disciples and thought them the learnings from the showman. \nLike how we get ourselves owed to our gurus; A blessed and blissful disciple would thy become a devotee for ‘the blissful guru’, who has explained about the inner secrets of human life without any strings attached.\nAnd thus we would place his guru at pinnacle and thy worship him as Guru Brahma, Guru Vishnu, Guru devo Maheshwara; Guru sakshat, param Brahma, tasmai shri guravay namah.\n\nBrahma is called in Indian Culture as Creator of World\nVishnu is referred as Maintenance of World\nShiva is referred as Destroyer of World\nParaBharma is Self  {our language - Showman} i.e.; Brahman -&gt; Mentioned in Upanishads and Gita { Refer Link - Brahman }\n\nThe Enlightened Disciple would be praising his guru as comparing to Brahma, Vishnu & Shiva. As comparing to Knowledge giver, Solution Seeker & Destroyer of Ignorance i.e.; in Contemporary we refer as Learn, Intact & Unlearn. \nAlso final verse explains; about the enlightened Disciple who thy realised that the enlightenment is in realising about the true nature of showman i.e.; in Contemporary we refer the real guru is self inquiry and the inner guiding light. { Ref the Pic below: When the Student is Ready, the teacher will appear }\nThis worship to God {Supreme God i.e.; Showman} is also been called as Bhakti Yoga { Bhakti Marga} in our Indian Culture. It is usually referred to as devotion of trust and love to a personal God.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the last three blogs I have learnt about Jnana Yoga, Karma Yoga and Bhakti Yoga which are referred as the three spiritual paths in our Culture to realize  about the Supreme God i.e.; our Showman."

    "text": "This blog piece comes almost after a year but at the right time, albeit there is a long hiatus. Lately, I have started a Spiritual YouTube Channel (in line with this blog series), wherein I’m sharing personal-level comprehension instead of metaphysical levels.\nHere is the link to my YouTube Channel { Link } ; kindly subscribe if you enjoyed this series.\nWhile I have completed the explanation of the Gnana, Karma & Bhakti Yoga videos, I have realized that there is an underlying concept of perennial happiness by combining these three Yogas.\nBefore delving directly into the blog, let me summarize the prime pointers mentioned in the Video Series.\nRe-cap of YouTube Channel First 4 Videos:\nThe root cause of unhappiness is our own thinking or thought process. Since our thought process hinders us from seeing the “world as-is” and instead, we see “the world as we want to see.”\nGnana Yoga: If we need to see the “world as-is,” the prime thing is not to get involved but to just observe. Such that our thought process changes from reacting to comprehending the situation.\nKarma Yoga: After we comprehend the situation, we need to act based on the revised thought process which, in turn, is based on our comprehension.\nBhakti Yoga: Once we start to act on the thoughts based on comprehension rather than reaction, we tend to observe that the results of the actions we take are going in a positive direction. This, in turn, helps us to love our own thought process.\n\n\n\n\n\nBlog:\nLet us consider an acting profession.\nActing: Assume that one wants to become a good and better actor. Let us assume that he/she thinks about his/her career impartially, leading to the selection of roles with clarity in their thought process. Once he/she selects the roles, he/she gives his/her 100% in acting. However, the results are in the hands of critics and audiences, which can go either way.\nSince he/she is clear in his/her thought process to become a better actor, he/she takes cues from past roles and learns from critics and audiences, and further implementing them in their next movie. His/Her learnings and comprehensions about being an actor improve movie after movie. He/She tries to become a better version of thyself compared to their previous movie, as their impartial thought process focuses on being a good and better actor. This makes them happier, knowing that he/she is progressing to become a better actor. Since, there is no limit for betterment; His/Her experimentation and exploration to become a better continuous till he/she strives for it. At a distance it looks like a diligent and hardworking model. However, upon closer inspection, one can discern a continuous journey of self improvement. The Ultimate happiness is about progressing thyself without future regrets. If one can take actions “now” resulting from clear thought process, that action is the first step towards happiness. Moreover, when one’s purpose is beyond their existence, their continuous action is bounded by love towards upon their “clear” thought process. This iterative process of taking incremental steps in our own life leads to various degrees of “delta happiness”, ultimately guiding us into a perpetual state of bliss.\nI will be creating a YouTube Video as well on the similar lines in next couple of days. ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nMy previous blogs for reference -\n\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/learnings-indian-culture/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning101/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning102/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning103/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning104/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning105/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning106/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning107/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning108/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning109/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning110/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning111/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning112/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning113/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning114/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning115/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning116/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning117/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning118/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning119/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning120/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning121/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning122/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning123/"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Till March 18th I { Arun Koundinya } was never worried about Corona Virus. The prime reason being  is that; I was not aware of the impact that it could create and as well I was surrounded by false facts.\nVideo Interview by Karan Tappar with Laxmi Narayan has made me humble to rethink the whole situation.\n\nIf you hadn’t listen this master piece yet; I request you to listen to entire conversation patiently for 50 minutes.\nSo, we Arun Koundinya & Mahesh Kolli { Who is a Doctor & this blog co-author } thought to create awareness and present you the right facts for the larger audience. Please share and create awareness. There are more people like me { Arun } who have less information about the pandemic.\n\n1) What is the difference between a virus and a bacteria ?\nViruses are very small infectious agents that can only replicate inside other living cells. Bacteria are slightly larger than viruses and are made up of a single cell. They are very simple organisms, and most can replicate outside other cells. They are virtually everywhere virus only works by invading a cell within an organism and taking over that cell’s machinery to reproduce itself. By itself, it doesn’t contain all ability to do everything it needs to survive and replicate. It essentially has to parasitise that other cell. so it means that bacteria multiply outside your body but doesn’t need your help to multiply but viruses need you as a host multiply\nTo look at it; it needs us to survive itself. It is its survival instinct.\n\n\n2) What is the origin of common zoonotic viruses to humans and where does the virus live in the human body and how many days\nZoonotic infections are not new. They have always featured among the wide range of human diseases and most, e.g. anthrax, tuberculosis, plague, yellow fever and influenza, have come from domestic animals, poultry and livestock.\nHowever, with changes in the environment, human behaviour and habitat, increasingly these infections are emerging from wildlife species.\nAccording to the global example, type 1 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) originated in chimpanzees and Ebola virus in bats. 6 Estimations show that there are more than 1.6 million mammalian and waterfowl viruses, spanning 25 viral families known to cause human infections.\nThe whole world is in the grip of the coronavirus now. The pandemic started in December 2019 in Wuhan, China and has spread insidiously world over. Coronaviruses have been identified over 60 years ago as one of the agents which cause the annoying common cold. There are 4 types of the beta-coronavirus family which can cause the disease. But, like the influenza virus, it has the uncanny ability to mutate often. The first such instance of a dangerous mutation was in 2002, the SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) outbreak from Hong Kong, which afflicted over 8,000 people and resulted in around 800 dead (a mortality of 10%). It is believed to have originated in bats, which are, incidentally, asymptomatic and transmitted via civet cats to humans. The second catastrophe was the mutation resulting in MERS (Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome), which originated again from bats, and affected humans through an intermediate host, the dromedary camels, in Saudi Arabia. By last counts, there have been around 2,500 cases with over 750 deaths (a mortality of 35%). The current outbreak is again due to a mutated coronavirus labelled by WHO as SARS-CoV-2, which is believed to have originated from bats in a live animal and sea-food market in Wuhan, and infected man through an intermediary host (? pangolin). The virus has the ability to infect lung cells through a receptor known as ACE-2, leading to complications of pneumonia and respiratory failure. COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, has affected over 150 countries, 3,00,000 people with over 13,000 deaths. In India, 476 infections have been identified with nine deaths.\n\n\n\nCoronaVirus Animal Groups & Target Tissues\n\n\nThe PREDICT project has already discovered over 1000 viruses, including novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses that can infect human Cells PREDICT project of the United States Agency for International Development’s Emerging Pandemic Threats programme.\nThe virus spreads through respiratory droplets from an infected person. It could directly spread through inhalation of droplets when you are within a metre of a coughing patient, but more often, it is by touching inanimate objects contaminated by these droplets and taking our hands near our nose and mouth. This essentially means that if we are at least a metre away from anyone, and wash our hands frequently, it is highly unlikely that we would be infected. This is the rationale behind the concept of social / physical distancing. Even though the virus can survive for substantial periods on inanimate objects (a day on cardboard and 2-3 days on plastic and steel, under ideal conditions), it dies on drying.\nTo look at it; there is much needed capability to include Veterinary Scientists going forward to predict such mutated genome viruses.\n\n\n3) What is the necessity of Quarantine.\nQuarantine is used to separate and restrict the movement of well persons who may have been exposed to a communicable disease to see if they become ill. These people may have been exposed to a disease and do not know it, or they may have the disease but do not show symptoms. Quarantine can also help limit the spread of communicable disease.\nSeparation If you are potentially infectious, it is important that you separate yourself from your partner, your housemates, your children, your elderly aunt. To be on the safe side, you shouldn’t even pet your dog, according to the C.D.C., although pets are not known to transmit the coronavirus.  A room must be designated for your exclusive use. A bathroom should be, too, if possible. Every surface you cough on or touch could become contaminated with the virus. Masks If you must be around other people — in your home, or in a car, because you’re on your way to see a doctor (only after you have called) — you should wear a mask, and everyone else should, too.\nBut first, you or one of your friends or family members have to find masks, which are sold out almost everywhere. If you can’t, you can create a makeshift one from a scarf or other garment.\nHygiene If you cough or sneeze, you should cover your mouth and nose with a tissue, and discard the used tissue in a lined trash can. Then you must immediately wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 second Or more\n\n\n4) Chinese Epidemic the origin in Wuhan and how the lockdown worked\nAccording to the Chinese government data, a 55 year-old from Hubei province could have been the first person to have contracted Covid-19 on November 17. Hubei was the epi-center not wuhan as lot us may think . From that date onwards, one to five new cases were reported each day. By December 15, the total number of infections stood at 27 – the first double-digit daily rise was reported on December 17 – and by December 20, the total number of confirmed cases had reached 60. By the final day of 2019, the number of confirmed cases had risen to 266, On the first day of 2020 it stood at 381. \nWhile the government records have not been released to the public, they provide valuable clues about how the disease spread in its early days and the speed of its transmission, as well as how many confirmed cases Beijing has recorded. On December 27, Zhang Jixian, a ophthalmologist doctor from Hubei Provincial Hospital of Integrated Chinese and Western Medicine, told China’s health authorities that the disease was caused by a new coronavirus. By that date, more than 180 people had been infected, though doctors might not have been aware of all of them at the time . \nHe warned his doctor colleagues to use protective equipment and gear in private groups for which he did not go down well with the communist government who try to underplay the epidemic. Wuhan police summoned and admonished him for “making false comments on the Internet. Li returned to work, later contracted the virus from an infected patient and died from the disease on 7 February 2020, at age 33. A subsequent Chinese official inquiry exonerated him and the Communist Party formally offered a”solemn apology” to his family and revoked its admonishment of him and two other police officers. \nLockdown\nWhen the lockdown started on Jan. 23, residents were barred from leaving the city, and public transportation was canceled. In the following weeks, the lockdown tightened; authorities told residents that they couldn’t leave their homes without permission — and even kept track of who was buying cold medicine at the pharmacy. \nThose in quarantine were told to check themselves for fever twice a day — which more than half the respondents admitted they did not do. “Taking my temperature made my heart feel like it was going to pound out of my chest each time,” one respondent noted. \nThey varied in degrees of strictness—from checkpoints at building entrances and hard limits on going outside. At some apartment complexes, security guards kept people from entering and exiting. In Wuhan, armies of enforcers were deployed to ensure citizens complied with the lockdown, and volunteers went door-to-door checking residents’ temperatures. Those found to have fevers were sent to quarantine centers. \nDelivery drivers wearing hazmat suits, masks and goggles deliver a neighbourhood’s food orders to an agreed location (such as the porter’s lodge or a local landmark like a fountain) at a certain time of day, Will says. They then phone families to let them know the food has arrived. A family member wearing a single-use face mask and gloves and a special jacket will then come out to collect the family’s supplies. They spray their bags of shopping with a sanitiser, then carry the supplies back to their flat. \nEssential workers are tested for signs of coronavirus before they enter any building, and often randomly as they drive. “Testing is everywhere,” Will said. \nCertain ‘essential workers’ (such as doctors, nurses and other medical staff) are classified as at ‘high risk’ of contracting coronavirus. These are put up in special hotels to minimise the risk of the disease spreading. In cases where they do have to go home, they are advised to sleep in separate bedrooms to protect their family. \nEvery local neighbourhood has its own dedicated pharmacy. Accredited volunteers deliver medication to the door of families that need it. Specially trained volunteers also support families where a member has fallen ill with a condition that is not coronavirus. For several weeks now, no-one has been allowed either out of or into Wuhan, by car, bus, rail, air or boat. \nEssential workers, such as doctors, nurses and other medical staff, police, local government workers, delivery drivers, certain factory staff, and workers who helped build the city’s new temporary hospitals, are granted special licences to be able to drive, so that they can get to and from work. These licences have to be applied for in advance by their employers. No-one else can drive. \nThe Wuhan travel ban alone had reduced 202,000 cases in China, delaying epidemic growth and buying valuable time for other areas to mobilise and response, as per a  research study done by 22 scientists.\n\n\n5) What is the index case and how Wuhan Marked had Community transmission\nThe index case (sometimes colloquially referred to as patient zero) is the first documented patient in a disease epidemic within a population or the first documented patient included in an epidemiological study. \nOther Stories;\nConsider the story of Gaëtan Dugas, a gay flight attendant for Air Canada in the early 1970s. He was cast in many reports as Patient Zero of the HIV/AIDS epidemic and became a medical scapegoat in North America in the 1980s. Human error and alarmist reporting fuelled the false narrative until Dugas was exonerated in 2016 — 32 years after his death \nMary Mallon, better known as Typhoid Mary, is the most often-cited case. Born in Ireland in 1869, Mallon emigrated to the U.S. in 1884 where she began working for a variety of wealthy families as a domestic before she became a cook. She was also a healthy carrier of Salmonella typhi — typhoid fever — meaning that she was infected with the pathogen but never showed any signs or symptoms herself. When a medical researcher discovered her condition, Mallon was placed in a three-year quarantine. \nCorona Virus;\nSo whereas the index case or patient zero couldn’t be identified as the index case might have been around in china before November. According to news reports the first patient to report to a clinic was on December 10th { Wei Guixian, a seafood merchant in this city’s Hua’nan market, first started to feel sick}. Thinking she was getting a cold, she walked to a small local clinic to get some treatment and then went back to work. Eight days later, the 57-year-old was barely conscious in a hospital bed, one of the first suspected cases in a coronavirus epidemic that has paralysed China and gripped the global economy.\nThe virus has spread around the world and sickened more than 100,000. For almost three weeks, doctors struggled to connect the dots between Ms. Wei and other early cases, many of them Hua’nan vendors. Patient after patient reported similar symptoms, but many, like her, visited small, poorly resourced clinics and hospitals. Some patients balked at paying for chest scans; others, including Ms. Wei, refused to be transferred to bigger facilities that were better-equipped to identify infectious diseases. When doctors did finally establish the Hua’nan link in late December, they quarantined Ms. Wei and others like her and raised the alarm to their superiors.\n\n\n6) Which Age group of population is affected?\nTo be clear, nobody should feel invulnerable to the coronavirus. Young people are going to contract the disease, a not-insignificant percentage of them are going to get very sick, and a smaller number {negligible people} will die. The rates of severe and deadly cases might not be nearly as high as the older generations that we are worried about, but the data already show that age alone does not make you invincible. One, there is some indication that men could be at a higher risk of severe symptoms and death than women.\nIn the initial Wuhan, China, outbreak, for example, men were dying at a notably higher rate than women. We’ve seen the same trend in Italy. But we will need more research and data to be sure about the effect of gender on a patient’s prognosis.\nSecond, we know that people who have underlying medical conditions face higher odds of getting really sick or dying from Covid-19, particularly those with heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, lung disease, and cancer.\nHaving one or more of those conditions increases a person’s risk of severe symptoms.\n\n\n7) Index cases in India\nThe first three cases in India were reported between 30 January and 3 February in Kerala. All three patients had returned from Wuhan, China — the epicentre of what has now been declared a pandemic.\nThe country’s next two cases were reported nearly a month later, on 3 March — one patient in Delhi who had a travel history to Italy, and the second in Hyderabad, who had travelled from Dubai.\n\n\n8) Does not following the correct dosage of medicines than normal cycle will re-grow the virus?\nMost of you might be aware of Anti-Biotic resistance which is primarily related to bacteria related diseases.\nHowever, the anti-viral drug resistance is more dangerous because of virus survival instinct it might learn to adapt to the drugs. So, in all scenarios let us not be a doctor of our own and never prescribe thyself which might be harmful for future generations.6\nIn all good scenarios, it is always better to develop our own immune system healthily with natural and good wholesome balanced nutritional food. Hygiene also is of paramount importance. Resisting temptation to eat from unhygienic and learning to not self medicate from the pharmacy shop.\nInstead of self medicating i encourage everyone to get a complete health check every 6 months or on bad scenario for every 12 months at good labs and visit a good family specialist in your area .\n\n\n9) Why we are not immune to such new Novel Viruses?\nLong lasting immunity is obtained by means of the adaptive immune system, and mainly involves the development of antibodies that identify specific parts (epitopes) of the pathogen’s proteins. Common cold is typically caused by a type of virus called rhinovirus. Viruses have very high mutation rates, which alter the sequence of the virus proteins, modifying their antigenic properties.  This consequently alters the ability of antibodies to recognise a particular antigen.\nIn other words, we do develop long lasting immunity against the virus that causes us a cold today, but the virus that causes us a cold a few months later is somewhat different, and the adaptive immune system has to start from scratch.\nIf it is a complete new virus the antibodies have no clue to recognise the antigen that’s the reason why all the conspiracies gets developed as well.\n\n\nTo Conclude,\n\nFew of you might have come across this research paper Link; Which reminded me of a proverb ‘A Stitch in Time Saves NINE’;  If you have no time reading that paper here are last few lines { The presence of a large reservoir of SARS-CoV-like viruses in horseshoe bats, together with the culture of eating exotic mammals in southern China, is a time bomb. The possibility of the reemergence of SARS and other novel viruses from animals or laboratories and therefore the need for preparedness should not be ignored. }. While writing this blog we have as well learnt that the Chinese government has banned the wild life trade as well. Which is a welcome move.\nWith respect to the current situation we have to now respect each other and follow the orders of the government and maintain a strict quarantine for at-least 21 days which might be revised to higher number going forward.\nI convey my heartfelt thanks to Donald Trump who has posted the drug medicine to the entire world which fastens the speed to save millions. And Indian Government acting on it very quickly and issuing the same to our doctors. Also, while writing this blog we have learnt that FDA has approved “Convalescent plasma transfusions”. In simple words the blood from recovered patient will be used for treating the ill/critical patient.\nNever miss the complete the dosage and never take your medicines on your own which are especially Scheduled H or Scheduled Drugs. Always follow Registered Doctor Advice.\nFinally, we have to be responsible by being under strict quarantine and following orders of government and respective authorities."

    "text": "If you have heard about 99Club. This article is about possibility of shifting from 99Club to 100Club.\n“Dad!!! Good Morning. Yesterday I came across the term - ‘99Club’. I feel there is something awry about the concept. Have you felt it so?”\nHis dad got confused and asked - ” I always felt awry from the time when you started thinking and questioning me. This awry ofcourse should be new for me. Please continue son.”\nVikram smiled for his Dads Sarcasm and continued, “Let me cut down the crap and get straight to the point”.\n“Of course you should. Your dad is not yet retired.”\n“Dad!!!!”, said Vikram, by nodded his head side ways with a smile; and continued, ” The concept of 99Club seems to be about being happy with what we have. If we are happy with what we have then we become complacent and tend to be comfort zone. Right.  And this may lead to zero goal life.?”\n“Hope you are not saying me to that - ‘Dad; don’t get retire and become complacent.’. such that your eternal pocket money flow will be assumed forever.”\n“Dad!!! Please.”\n“Vikram, I’m trying to protect myself for any kind of shock that you might give it to me. However, your body language and expression communicating to me that you are indeed looking for some parental guidance after a long time. Great.”, saying this he set aside the file plank and got up from his chair and sat beside his son and continued, “Vikram, we had the same discussion long time ago. Happiness and goal are not related.”\n\n“I understand that dad. Like for example, Apple would not have become a large company if they become complacent. But 99Club concept says that - be happy with what you have”\n\n“Very Good. Did it became large company in a year?”\n\n“No. It took them long. Which is what I’m trying to say”\n\n“How many goals did Apple achieved”\n\n“If you mean in terms of products. It is iTune, Mac, iPhone, iPod etc.; so far as i can recollect”\n\n“Lovely. If we get back to the story of 99Club. Do u think iTune, Mac, iPod are individual coins which Apple is trying to collect to make it to 100?”\n\n“Nope Dad. Each is an individual project with different timelines. Success of each project pushed them to go for an extra mile each time”\n\n“How did they enjoy their each of their success”\n\n“They celebrated and shared their happiness with shareholders and stakeholders”\n\n“Great Vikram; You have contradicted your own assumption earlier. Isn’t it so. As you said, Apple is indeed was happy for their success and what they possess. However, they never got deviated from their larger goal of improving the customer experience through best use of technology.” He said and took and sip of water and then continued, ” The premise of 99Club is more about the humans relentless desire of non-completeness.”\n\nVikram, absorbed what is being told and thought for a while and said, “What Makes it Complete?”\n\n“That is a great question. We cannot bring in the Company discussion in this question as company by itself cannot make it complete. As it runs on Goals, Vision, Mission and finally by numbers. On the other side, humans are run by emotions most of the times.”\n\n“Of Course. Humans are emotional beings”\n\n“What do you think makes my day Vikram.”\n\nWithout any delay Vikram replied, ” As I know you, You feel happy whenever you spent some quality time with mom or me.”\n\n“Why do you think it makes me complete?”\n\n“Is it because you like them most?” Vikram questioned his father and nodded his head with a smile.\n\n“It is usually the other way round. It is because you both like being around with me.” said his father, ” In generally, if we share our positive emotions or moments with loved ones. It makes our day and make it complete. :) “\n\n”This is lovely. But however, I’m unable to relate this to control of relentless desires of human.”\n\n“Vikram. Human runs each and every day such that he and his future family is in a better off position.”\n\n“Agree”\n\n“However, there are some immediate dependants and some other indirect dependants; And all these dependants love to spend time with us. All we have to acknowledge them and give them some time, love and positive moments and emotions.”\n“Most of the times, all these interactions and moments make us realise that our dependants are happy with the existing status quo as well. Which shifts our gear from getting bigger in terms of desire to reaching to our goal.”\n\n“This is lovely to hear Dad. Love and belongingness plays a major role in our life”\n\n“Yes. it is more lovely because it gets strengthened when we reciprocate in a right way.”\n\nVikram got up and smiled and said to his father, “Dad!!! I got the message. I think i need to find girlfriend to make me complete.”\n\n“Good for you. All the best.”\nI would like to conclude this blog by saying HAVE A SWEET TIME WITH OUR SWEET HEARTS TO MAKE OUR LIFE SWEEEET  :)\nOne of my Fav. scene from Teen Maar Telugu movie { A Remake of Hindhi Movie - Love Aaj Kal }"

    "text": "Continuing from previous blogs:\nWe have observed where the Rishi who gets enlightened through self inquiry with a true inherent desire to meet the Showman; they would like to come forward to share the similar experience to his few selected disciples; and thus ‘the Rishi’ becomes ‘the Guru’.  Who have created a way for each and everyone of us (In terms of Personal God) to get us liberated and realize the Showman within ourselves. And then we learnt that people who embark a travel to meet the showman are termed as ‘Brahmacharya’; To get motivated to meet the showman they start to pray the Sun who is more visible and tangible; and then continue their path for the ultimate showman.\nRishis Disciple is now in a confusion mode asking about the inner light dualities among the people and again got into confusion when he envisaged that his realization to showman has to be Sacrificed to realize him. His question of “why pooja” made him to realize that it should not be a ritual but a method to concentrate to realize the god. Whatever work we do, if we perform as per direction of showman we will attain peace and not thinking about the reward and living out of vicious loop of Gunas.\nNow Shishya is trying to learn about the pains and its conflicts.\nWe left the previous blog with this question.\nAfter few moments, ” How can we get out of the conflict zone!! Guruji. “,  asks Shishya restlessly.\nAnd then Rishi/Guru responds in this way:\nGuruji smiles and responds, ” How do you define a zone? ”\n” It means a territory; I’m assuming that you want me to re-define my question. Here it goes, how to get out of the conflict-territory that we habitually dwell?”\nGuruji again responds with serene smile, ” Don’t dwell in that territory? “ \n” What would be the course. If we cannot come out of that territory? ”\nGuruji quickly answers, ” This statement conflicts with your question itself. A while ago, you want to come out of that zone and now you are insisting that you cannot come out of that zone. Succinctly, you are pre-meditated to dwell in the conflict zone “ \nShishya pauses for a minute and closes his eyes and pray, ” Guruji, let me rephrase my question. How to avoid being in that conflict zone ? ”\n” Picking up from our earlier conversation (last blog),  conflict arises due to the interaction effect of past to present. Ideally, we have to start with a fresh slate of mind every moment in our life! ”\nShishya interrupted with anxiety and asked, ” Are you saying that we should have a consistent memory loss ”\nGuruji says while he is signalling to sit on the bench,” That dead tree has become this bench with the aid of our memory. I don’t underestimate the power of our minds. What I mean is not to ax all the living trees because Guruji is enjoying his comfort on that bench. As we have formed an opinion based on what we observe from the original fact in the entire prejudice hierarchy ”\n\nWatch from the 6th Minute onwards\nGuruji continues, ” The conflict surfaces whenever we accept our opinions, our beliefs, and our so-called  prejudices as mere facts. And this assumed fact will have a conflict with reality, as it is not the fact. To avoid that conflict we should have a fresh slate of mind, which means to stop forming opinions and just observe. ”\nShishya looks as if his quench for knowledge is done. However, within a moment with his unrest expression, ” It looks good on paper, would that be possible or is it a practical solution? ”\n— Answer in next blog\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nMy previous blogs for reference -\n\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/learnings-indian-culture/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning101/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning102/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning103/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning104/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning105/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning106/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning107/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning108/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning109/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning110/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning111/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning112/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning113/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning114/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning115/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning116/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning117/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning118/"

    "text": "Continuing from the previous blog - Link\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the previous blog, we learned about ATMAN. It is nothing but a consciousness that keeps us moving ahead. If we identify ourselves with ATMAN, ATMAN defines us.\nIf we zoom out from the unit level to the environment, there would be several ATMANs ( or consciousness ). It is like several consciousnesses trying to guide their living entity. To draw an analogy, it is like people wearing a head torch and living together. ( Head torch can be your ATMAN )\n\n\n\n\n\nFor generations, there have been many species and lives that “the head torch has guided.” Also, surrounding us, the lives, planets, and galaxies evolved so synchronously as if there is a continuous power supply to those “head torches.” That Continuous supply of power that has powered the lives and larger universe is called BRAHMAN. In other words, it is also called super consciousness. ( This doesn’t mean to propagate that there is a superintelligence synchronizing the lives, but to give a context of what Brahman is. ). \nIn an alternative way - Even though there have been considerable changes like we are launching so many satellites, increasing the global temperature, etc.; The sun appears every day, all planets revolve around the sun, and all seasons come to us every year ( for which we depend). So irrespective of the Universal Maya, the universe constantly evolves and empowers many lives in its journey.\nSuppose ATMAN is like recognizing the guiding light within us, which empowers us. BRAHMAN is like a guiding light for so many lives that empowers others.\nIf we move our identity from ATMAN to BRAHMAN, we term it “Aham Brahmasmi.” \nBut how can we move our identity to BRAHMAN? Are there any Universal rules or guiding principles?\n- Answer in the next blog"

    "text": "Long ago, my close friend used to say “There is a reason for everything we do; All it needs is to put our guts to know the reason to go ahead in right direction”.\nOften lately I have started questioning myself - “Why am writing blogs? What is the necessity of writing blogs? If I want to write what should I write?” This was first surfaced to my subconscious on 22nd March 2015, the day after I have received my second masters’ degree in “Business Analytics” at ISB Hyderabad.\nIn the course of time a lot of questions have exploded in my head. So, I felt that there is a need to understand the roots of my blogging habit (how it has started and matured over time).\nTo understand my habit, I have used the most fascinating and powerful book, “How Habits Work” by Charles Duhigg. In this book he mentions that habit works in a loop as Cue, Routine and Reward.\n\n\n\n\n\nI have started blogging from the year 2010 to improve my communication skills only. Certainly, I have used blogger as a platform to improve my written skills such that when people read my blogs they should not feel awkward about my way of expression. Also, I’m fortunate enough to receive best in class feedback from my friends, family and well-wishers. And if you are able to comprehend this particular piece of blog, of course it is their consistent feedback that helped me to improve.\nAfter a year, I have upgraded my usage of blogger platform for expressing my personal views on well-known topics/issues. This helped me to improve my essay structure. Eventually, after six months I have dried out of interesting topics. So, I consulted my friends and well-wishers on any topic that they would like to have a novel analysis. Thus the blog finally emerged as http://www.arunviews.com {which is currently not available}. In this blog, I have started to share my own views on various topics of audience interest. Certainly, this helped me to improve my reading and analytical skills as I have to comprehend on multifarious topics and provide short analysis.\nIn a while, my habit loop for blogging has become: Cue: Finalizing one of the topic for the blog provided by my friends. Routine: Read and Analyze on the specific topic & post the blog online. Reward: Expression of satisfaction of the topic especially by topic provider.\nIndeed, I was enjoying in this way for more than a year. Also, whenever I see a research on similar lines of my blog it always provided me a deep sense of satisfaction. However, as I have started to read and analyze on various topics; my particular interest on confluence of Psychology, Analytics and Management always leave me intrigued, amazed and thrilled. Consequently, I could not generate further cue for writing blogs as I hardly created a blog of my own topic.\nSo I would like to change my existing habit loop for blogging as below: Cue: Pick a topic of my interest in the confluence area of three topics. Routine: Read and Analyze on the specific topic & post the blog online. Reward: Expression of satisfaction of the topic by the blog reader and by myself.\nIt gives a sense of fulfilment in finding out the reasons of our old habits and to take the outcome in our stride. Therefore, I would like to write blogs of my own interest which leaves me extremely happy and satisfied when I finally post it online."

    "text": "Cambridge Dictionary says: Fear = an unpleasant emotion or thought that you have when you are frightened or worried by something dangerous, painful, or bad that is happening or might happen.\nStress = great worry caused by a difficult situation,\nLet us go through a similar conversation as we read in our previous post. However, this time the conversation is between two close friends who are planning to get married.\nThe below described scenario is a very simple where most of the youngsters might have experienced at-least once.\nAbout the Roles:\nVidhya - A Civil Engineer Graduate working in a Government Company for last one and half year.\nRavi - Final Year Engineering Student. { Who got placed in Apple Company in Bangalore }\n————————————————————————————————————————————————————–\nIt is 4:00 P.M. of 31st Oct 2017\nRavi, who is in quick term gap for a week, is waiting near the entrance of Prasadz Multiplex for his love. Being Monday it is always tough for any working person to leave early from Office and the same is for Vidhya.\n\nRavi waved hand at her when she was stepping out of Auto Rickshaw. And he went till entrance gate of the Multiplex to receive his love.\n\n“Kya huva Madam ji, you called me so urgently from college.” asked Ravi eagerly by placing his left hand over her shoulder and drawing her closer to his body.\n\nVidhya with her left hand took away his hand softly and said, “We are in public darling!!!”\n\n“This sounds very new to me dear. It seems my lady had a bad day at Office today?” said Ravi by doing the same act again.\n\nShe reacted to it by walking briskly and then sat on top row of the entrance steps and said firmly, “I’m fine!” and then quickly changed her tone and said softly, “My dear sweet heart. Why don’t we sit here and chat for some time. It’s been so long that we met face to face.”\n\nRavi got puzzled for a second by her act and did as per her wish.\n\nThey just stared at the nature for few minutes till rain intervened their present status quo which forced them to pass the security and get inside the multiplex.\n\n“Which movie shall we go dear” asked Ravi while running over the pamphlet of ‘This Weeks Movie’.\n\nShe didn’t respond but just pretended to get lost in the surroundings.\n\n“Sweety, I think this movie list might not impress you. Can we go for a short 4DX movie. Are you in the game with me?”\n\nStill she pretended to get lost in the surroundings and started walking towards the food court.\n\nRavi followed from her behind. She simply ordered “1 Caffe Latte Large Please” and then sat on the sofa.\n\nRavi lost his all cool and sat fierce fully beside her and drew her face towards him with his both hands and shouted, “What-sup to you!!! Do you think I have travelled 700 odd miles from college to have this experience??? What do you want to convey to me?? Why don’t you speak up to me?”\n\n“Your Caffe Latte Large Ma’am” said the server by placing the coffee on the table with a smile and then he quickly passed to his counter.\n\nShe took the coffee mug slowly, enjoyed the aroma of the coffee and started to have the coffee sip-by-sip.\n\nRavi lost his temper again and said, “Miss Vidhya!!!, I’m leaving right now. This is high disrespect for a future Apple Employee”.  Saying this he put his iPhone in his left pocket and briskly walked away to the exit of the mall.\n\nShe responded to his behaviour by enjoying the coffee. By the time she finished having the final sip of coffee Ravi returned again silently and sat beside her.\n\n“Darling!!! What happened? Why are you doing like this? Did I do anything in aberration that has lost belief in me? (or) Are you getting MARRIED??? For god sake why don’t you speak up.” said Ravi in a normal voice.\n\n“My Dear Sweet Heart!!! You looked soo panic and worried and seems to be stressed out. Calm down. What did I do??” Replied Vidhya\n\n“What!!!!” replied Ravi with wide opened eyes and continued, “Of course your behaviour is creating a confusion for me which is leading to stress.”\n\n“Why are you getting stressed for my behaviour?”\n\n“I’m unable to understand how you are behaving. It is getting difficult to decipher what point you are trying to make.” said Ravi.\n\n“I didn’t get my answer Sweety. I think I asked you the wrong question. What makes you ‘more stressed’ now. Are you saying is it my behaviour or something else.” replied Vidhya calmly by seeing his eyes and continued, “I know you are intelligent enough to know how your subconscious thinking works.”\n\n“Are you saying that the reason for stress is my own thought process???” replied Ravi annoyingly.\n\n“Give a thought for some time my dear. Okie let me help you on this. What happens just before to you when you experience severe stress.” Vidhya replied to Ravi by getting up from the CCD Sofa.\n\nRavi did the same and they both started walking together.\n\n“Hmmm… A series of thoughts or assumptions or visualisations in my brain on future consequent actions based on your current state of behaviour.” responded Ravi as if he is recollecting the images of thoughts from his brain.\n\n“That’s why I love you darling. And you made your honest point. Let us take your point little forward. What makes your brain to quickly construct the future consequent actions.”\n\n“To be more honest with you as of now I thought that your marriage got fixed and you have accepted it.”\n\nVidhya laughed loudly and now she drew him closer to her body by keeping her right hand on his shoulder.\n\n“Sorry for the act played. But I will explain you the reason soon once we complete this discussion.” said Vidhya.\n\nVidhya continued,”Why did you think that my marriage got fixed?”\n\nAs the rain got stopped both them passed the other side of the gate and started walking towards N.T.R. Gardens.\n\nRavi regained his lost coolness and replied, “You have been saying from last four months that there is a pressure from your home on your marriage.”\n\n“Yes of course. It is still there. Okie, on a negative side what will happen if I get married to some one else?”\n\n“Vidhya, I request you not to say this at least in your dreams. I cannot loose you and I cannot think my life without you.” said Ravi.\n\n“So…” responded Vidhya immediately.\n\n“I cannot loose. That’s it. PERIOD.” replied Ravi strongly.\n\n“Can I conclude that the reason for your act is ‘fear of loosing me from your life’”, responded Vidhya.\n\n”I think so”.\n\n“If so, after your campus placement in the month of May. Why you couldn’t convey about our love to your parents. Where you have promised me exactly an year back here at the same place. Are you able to recollect it darling”. responded Vidhya.\n\nWith a blank and thoughtful mind Ravi along with Vidhya sat on a bench in N.T.R. Gardens.\n\nIt is 5:10 P.M. of 31st Oct 2017\n\n“To boost your confidence Ravi. I have told you many times that it will take me 4 more years to reach your offered CTC. Haven’t I? Also, I have never forced for a marriage, but due to our age difference I have been pushing you on that, such that our elders will converse soon. Didn’t I.”\n\nRavi gave a deep thought and sigh, “Now, I understand the reason for my 700 KM Travel. I definitely owe an explanation to you.”\nHe took a deep breath and continued,\n“I’m afraid of my father. On top of that our age gap keep my mouth shut whenever I tried to initiate the conversation on the similar lines.”\n\n“Who doesn’t have fear of explaining his love to their parents it is an universal fear for all the lovers. However, most the best love marriages occur when lovers manage the both fears successfully and convince their elders. Am I Right.” responded Vidhya.\nAnd again continued,\n“As per my understanding you have two fears which is splitting you apart which is causing you severe  stress.\n\n\n\nFear of loosing me\nFear of loosing parents { Like loosing their respect or something else }\n\nwhich of course happens for most of the lovers.”\n\nVidhya then turned her head to his side and took her both hands and tilted his head to her side as well and kissed him. And then she continued,\n“Now, I have a strong belief in my future Apple Company Employee that you can manage your both fears and make the best act that benefits all of us.” she smiled and got up and departed with a hug.\n\nRavi sat on the same bench and started to think seriously about his next actions & steps.\n\n—————————————————————————————————————————————————————\nFoot Note:\n\nF.E.A.R. { Not about Conditional Fear }\nAn underrated feeling which is the root cause of our survival as well as failures and etc.;\nA Balance of Managing the FEAR is utmost necessary to avoid stress and its related activities.\n1) If we couldn’t be afraid, we wouldn’t survive for long.

    "text": "Note: This is an opinionated article especially with respect to Indian sub-continent.\nThe current situation puts a heavy strain to balance between lives and livelihoods. Nonetheless Indian government and respective state governments are doing their best to ease this strain in the best possible way.\nSaving lives become very important because there are not just numbers and they are individuals. However, let us try to understand the gross numbers of deaths and its causes in India per Day. As per current estimate approximately 24,000 people in India die each and every day.\n\n\n\nFig1: Deaths Per Day Along with Top Reasons by Age Bracket - Govt. of India Data\n\n\nNote: In the sample the Income Level & Education Level is not mentioned.\nThe most disturbing number that i came across during this computation on excel sheet is the infant deaths due to Pneumonia is almost 300 to 400 per day. This number suggests that may be most of the people might be below or around poverty line {As the underlying reasons seems to be of lack of nutrition, hygiene and right health care at right time}; and on top of this “The Health Care Expenditure as % GDP” has not been improved much in this last decade.”\n\n\n\nFig2: Health Care Expenditure as %GDP of India vis-a-vis compared with other countries\n\n\nUsually “the current business as usual” the livelihoods and economy growth is already modelled and included for all the factors mentioned above. \nNow a “black swan” i.e.; CoronaVirus has entered into our lives and livelihoods which seems to have disturbed and created an imbalance between the both. Let us see the major timelines across the Globe and India of  Novel Corona Virus.\n\n\n\nFig3: Time Line of Events of Corona Virus\n\n\nEven after PHEIC declaration by WHO on 30th Jan’20 only few international countries has co-ordinated and most of them didn’t which had later burnt their fingers. { I said to myself that this is time when international friends has to help each other other than business and etc;}\nSeeing the India’s track record of Health Care and even the Best Health Care Countries facing upward trend of deaths; The best option and only option is for a National wide lock down. {Is the Lockdown right decision or wrong — As said by an expert on a bad case scenario there might be days where 5000 deaths per day would be possible if left as it is. So, the lock down helps to reduce the burden on the present health care system }\n\nSO LOCK DOWN IS NECESSITY\n\nLockdown comes up with a huge benefit for the people and of-course reduce the limits the spread; And soon we can declare the country as Corona Free in similar fashion on how Wuhan-China which declared Corona Free on 27th April 2020.\nOther side of see-saw of Lockdown is the loss of livelihoods and lesser business output and forced reduction of buying output which may trigger into recession. Since the lockdown there were numerous articles and opinions across recession and comparison with respect to great depression.  However, let us try to understand in theoretical terms what is the difference between the two.\nThere are no standard definitions for the same { Placing the Merriam-Webster definitions here }\nRecession: A recession is a downward trend in the business cycle, one that is characterised by a decline in production and employment. This trend lowers household income and spending, which consequently causes many businesses and households to delay making large investments or purchases\nDepression: A depression is a major downswing (far more severe than a downward trend) in the business cycle; one which is characterised by sharply reduced industrial production, widespread unemployment, a serious decline or cessation of growth in construction, and great reductions in international trade and capital movements. Another difference between a recession and a depression, in addition to the severity and effects of each, is that recessions may be limited geographically (limited to a single country), whereas depressions (such as the Great Depression of the 1930s) can occur across many nations.\nHere is the GDP Growth for the last decade which we can see that the economy is under slowdown from last two years and now comes the lockdown as well.\n\n\n\nFig4: GDP Growth% in last decade in India\n\n\nGood thing about the lock down is that it is not that all activities/sectors of GDP will be closed. Below is a table that might explain the possible impact as a guesstimate work.\n\n\n\nFig5: GDP Share across each sector & Sub-Sector | Assumed GDP is calculated based on 50% of GDP of Part-Essentials\n\n\nAlbeit the GDP may drop by 50% for few months the Employed Population who might not be temporary/permanently working would be 20% to 25% only { Including Migrant and Daily Wage Labourers - who might be the majority of them }\nIf India is a self sufficient country there is high chance of quick economic boom post the lift of lock down. However, we are not living in a just world we have trades, exchanges, forex, arbitrage, exports, imports and foreign dependant business. The good news for all of them is that it is not a structural fault in the economy so the rebound might be stronger and quicker than anticipated.\nThe Major Consultancies has provided a quick impact of the Indian Economy and suggested the way forward. The one which i liked is the KPMGs; Where they have displayed the three scenarios of Economy within India based on how the Government will react and consequent analysis by sector wise and suggestions.\n\n\n\nFig6: Scenarios of economic effects of COVID-19 for India\n\n\n{ Here is the link for the same  - https://home.kpmg/content/dam/kpmg/in/pdf/2020/04/potential-impact-of-covid-19-on-the-Indian-economy.pdf }\nTo Conclude: As we learnt from previous articles that there might be future outbreaks and epidemics of similar zoonotic viruses and business and people has to embrace the new normal and build the business models considering this factor as no more an outlier.\n\n\n\nFig7: Embracing the New Normal - As Suggested by KPMG\n\n\n\n\n\nFig8: Future Possible Zoonotic HotSpots across the world\n\n\n\nIt is great learning experience during the weekends and holidays of lockdown to learn on this corona virus pandemic. Readers will see more interesting articles in the coming weeks.\nOur Earlier Blogs:\n\nCOVID 19 : FACTS & REALTY CHECK - Where I learned about this pandemic - Published on 25th March 2020\nCOVID 19: NETIZEN REACTIONS - Where tried to show case few examples where netizens try to forward without a fact check. - Published on 29th March 2020\nCOVID 19: LESSONS FROM “IN” LAND - Our Learning from Kerala - Published on 5th April 2020.\nCOVID 19 : MEDICAL SCIENCE TO OVERCOME PANDEMIC - My Learning on the Corona Virus on Scientific Terminology. - Published on 15th of April 2020"

However, most people say it is trust; but it is a derivative of communication and intimacy space shared by each other.\nIn every relationship there are two actors and ideally I look it as a leader & follower relationship; However, the roles would be changing depending upon the situation.

    "title": "Does end in Poverty leads to end in Hunger? { Part -1 }",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Poverty: the state of being inferior in quality or insufficient in amount. Hunger: a situation in which the body does not have enough food. Above definitions becomes subjective without any substantial numerical adjective to it. So, the world bank updates the poverty line, as per changing cost of living, to identify the families whose economic position falls below the min. threshold/acceptance value. As of October 2015, the new global line updated to $1.90 per day i.e.; approx. 120 INR per day.\nIdeally the arriving at this number is extremely important as it helps the government to torchlight the projects & policies on alleviating the poverty through subsidies, health programs and etc.; which as well helps them to take necessary decisions on the viability of the programs.\nAs per these definitions, on an average 1 person out of 10 are in poverty globally; India has the same figures as well. { 2 in year 2011 }\nIt is in generally assumed that a person will be remained in poverty trap forever if his future earnings are less than that of present earnings. However, the inability of the poor to feed themselves properly is also one of the most frequently cited root causes of a poverty trap. The intuition is powerful: the poor cannot afford to eat enough; this makes them less productive and keeps them poor.\n\nIn last two decades thanks to the Indian Government for its policies and subsidies and thanks for our hard working people. 4/10 in year 2000 has reduced to 2/10 in 2011 and is expected to be 1/10 by this time.\n\nIf the above intuition is right the reverse is as well should be right. i.e.; when more people are becoming less poor there should be lesser and lesser hunger people. Also, the people who are in actual hunger has to be less than that of poor people.\n\nOn the contray, the figures showcases something different. 1 in 7 are in hunger. Figures would be worst, if we include the people who are in hidden hunger.\nSo, the above definitions on poverty suggests us that it is a one dimensional measure i.e.; income. This it all boils down to the fundamental principle of analytics i.e.; correlation and causality. Lower Income Correlates to Poverty. But does that explain the reasons for poverty. Because, the right measure and insight helps the government to deploy its resources and design the policies and create subsidies such that the required resources reaches to the needy in time. \n\nAs of now, Let us assume that the world banks benchmark on poverty is right. If the people has enough money to meet their basic needs then where does the money spent by poor goes ???\n\nDoes the poor are inclined to buy more tastier than nutritious.?\nDoes the subsidised food becomes over subsidised such that it makes the consumer surplus become negligible.?\nAre they love to spend on status acquiring things like tv, mobiles and etc.; than taking care of their health?\n\nTo conclude:\nThe world produces enough food to feed everyone. Achieving food and nutrition security is still a great challenge for the poorest around the world. The world continues to consume more food every year as the population grows, and due to rising demand for industrial uses of food."

Hope you will like it.\nThis is a conversation between a Psychotherapist and an young software programmer in their third sitting.\nPsychotherapist - Anupuma Programmer - Kid\nKid:  Good Evening Ma’am.\nAnupuma: Good Evening. You look better now. It is been almost couple of months since we meet. How have you been doing.\nKid: I’m doing good. Also, I’m getting better with myself.\nAnupuma: Good to hear this from you. Kid: Can I ask you one thing frankly. Anupuma: Yes… Continue Please. Kid: Although we spend so much effort in the right direction. Why there is failure? Anupuma: Why there has to be a success??\nKid gave a confused look and asked again - “Success is prime, that keeps motivated to go ahead. Isn’t it right?”\n“Well, Well, Well; Of course that does. However when i asked why there has to be success”, She paused and took a sip of water and continued,“I’m mentioning about the outcome.” “Dear, Success or Failure is a binary output variable for the work we do. Do you expect that you should have only ‘success’ in your life and not the failure?”\n“I don’t mean it Ma’am. I was saying that when we give our 100 percent effort to our fullest abilities and we know that we reached the goal. We expect a success and not a failure?”\n“That is good.”\n“You mean failure is good”.\nShe smiled and came beside him and said, ” I mean about effort and the fact that you know that you reached your goal. It is a success for you.”\n“If there isn’t anyone who would recognise it and take it forward. It is a pain. And what would I do with that success”\n\n“Let me clarify it my dear. There is a great difference between effort, performance, accomplishment and assessment”, she got up and took the black marker and drawn a movie film projector and the screen.\nShe continued, ” You remember the old movies. How they used to play. Unlike the digital projection now a days. A film is rolled and gets projected on the silver screen by aid of the projector.\nOur brain projects what is in our schema.\nIn your scenario. your film projected that - since you did great effort and provided exemplary performance and you did accomplish that you feel. The assessment towards it should get added to make it a complete success.\n\nIsn’t it so?”\nKid has gone into his deep thinking by trying to visualise and compare the set of events that has happened to him so far. And nodded the head.\nAnupuma continued, ” Also, you have tied your happiness with the complete success. Although you spent so much energy and effort you are unable to appreciate yourself.”\n“Can you explain me with a better example Ma’am. Am Unable to decipher what you are trying to say.”\n“Assume that you want to participate in 100m running race. So, get into participation you practice a lot, change your diet habits which is your effort. Say you want to finish the race in 15 seconds. You ran very well during the race and finished the race in say 14 seconds. This is called your performance and accomplishment. Now say that you finished 3rd as the 1st and 2nd runner finished in 13.40 & 13.50 seconds respectively. Finally this is your assessment part where you have to assess on how to finish the next race on number 1 spot.” “If you tie up the happiness with the assessment part. It will lead to stress and disappointment.” “Also, event the top most cricket team as well loose matches; although they have best players in their team or how best they perform. However, the team assess on how to win the next match. The team morale will goes down if they go in virtuous cycle of stress and disappointment.”\nAnupuma paused for a minute and allowed the kid to digest the example and continued, “Happiness is not a by product. It is a celebration of you being in the journey of your life”\n“Thanks a lot Ma’am. I think i got a new contrary evidence to my schema which will help me to change my habits.”\n\n“Come in fifteen days dear.”\n“Sure Ma’am. Thanks a lot”.\nI would like to end the article by saying that - LIVING is a present form speech. So, we have to be “In Present” while living.\n\nNote: It doesn’t mean we should not have future plans. I recommend that we should not spoil our journey path for future."

    "text": "There are certain situations for many of us in our lives, where we say this banal dialogue to ourselves or to our closed ones. “I didn’t expected him to behave like this.”. (or).”He is very elderly person. What is the reason for his eccentric behaviour?” and like wise many questions.\nThere are a number of links on web starting from Wikipedia to many that explain about Psychological Maturity. This is just my view point on it.\nMy assertion is that humans doesn’t have psychological maturity at all times. The underlying reason is that humans are emotional beings and are subject to varied emotions either by himself or due to external environment or Aura. { Aura is like the tag/brand that one carry }\nThere are two mistakes that usually we do. One is that we see the world from our view point and the second is that we expect the others to see the world from our view point. The problem doesn’t lie in having a strong view point but the other way round. Also, depending upon our will power on that particular day or moment our comprehension capability varies to a large extent.\nHowever, in any emotional turmoil or in a emotional hangover situation there is high chance that our intelligence is clouded by heavy emotions which makes us to react than to think. This moment is what i call as instant immaturity. Some realize this immaturity and correct their future behavior and some justify it adding it to their trait.\nLet us take this concept little forward, Usually by nature we all have irresistible commotion to judge others and personify their character based on the situational patterns that we see or observe. Let us assume that theoretically we have read about “How a spouse should behave?”. By all means spouse would not have behaved to that of our theoretical script that we read. Then we usually get into a conclusive state that spouse is not a spouse as its behavior is not depicting that of we read. So, here we can coin a new term called as ‘insta judging.’\n\nIn this example, we had shared a view point of author and got influenced by it to such an extent that we tried to juxtapose that particular view point on our spouse and didn’t tried to understand our spouse. This is called as ‘insta immuarity aided by judgement’\n\nBy nature, in most of the cases, later we tend to adjust with our spouses and start living with them; luckily Bayes theorem comes in handy to rescue our relationship to change our view point. As we start seeing view point of our spouse and then slowly start buying it and eventually loving it in its due course.\n\nTo Conclude, having a view point is our NATURE which drives our culture; Insta Judging is our HABIT that needs to be NURTURED to strengthen our culture.\n\nJAI HIND."

    "text": "Continuing from previous blogs:\nWe have observed where the Rishi who gets enlightened through self inquiry with a true inherent desire to meet the Showman; they would like to come forward to share the similar experience to his few selected disciples; and thus ‘the Rishi’ becomes ‘the Guru’.  Who have created a way for each and everyone of us (In terms of Personal God) to get us liberated and realize the Showman within ourselves. And then we learnt that people who embark a travel to meet the showman are termed as ‘Brahmacharya’; To get motivated to meet the showman they start to pray the Sun who is more visible and tangible; and then continue their path for the ultimate showman.\nRishis Disciple is now in a confusion mode asking about the inner light dualities among the people and again got into confusion when he envisaged that his realization to showman has to be Sacrificed to realize him. His question of “why pooja” made him to realize that it should not be a ritual but a method to concentrate to realize the god.\nWe left the previous blog where Shishya approaches to Guruji and asks , ” If everyone is looking to realize the showman to achieve the state of bliss, Who will do the work Guruji and keep the world running ? ”\nAnd then Rishi/Guru responds in this way: { This answer will be answered through conversations in next three blogs; This is second one - conversation continued from  previous one }\n” What is the need to complicate life ? ”\nShishya quickly responds, ” It is is the race on survival and living ”\n” What is needed for survival ? ”\n” To meet the basic needs like food, clothing and shelter ”\n” What is needed for living ? ” asks guruji again.\nConfused Shishya says , ” I think it is the same ”\nGuruji smiles and says , ” Is Bliss is not needed for Living ? ” and points the book of Taittraya Upanishad.\n\n\n\nFig: Ananda Valli - From Taittriya Upanishad { Do not confuse with Maslow Hierarchy }\n\n\n” Of course, every one wants Bliss ” says Shishya and continues, ” but how can people experience bliss when their life is intertwined for meeting their living needs ”\n” Most of us work for the comforts for our outer body, senses and for its maintenance; And then we work for our immediate responsibilities and for near future to achieve financial freedom ”\n” Thus, we are in this continuous game for ever in our life. Every generation does the same but the grammar and the terminology changes ”\n” Yes Guruji. It is also true that our body has certain responsibilities as we grow in our life. Isn’t possible for us, that when we are in our race to fulfil our responsibilities can’t we be in a state of bliss ” asked Shishya with intensity in a slow and milder tone.\n” Are you mentioning about responsibilities or Obligations ? ”\n” I think they are the same; If we are obliged, we gain responsibility ”\nGuruji Smiles and Says, ” Answer lies in your question itself. We live as if we are obliged for our body and to our near family. Due to which most of us don’t know how much enough is needed for our survival ; or else don’t know the way to meet the enough survival needs “ \n” Since we are in a cycle of obligation, we tend to look outside to close the obligations and gain freedom. However, it is a cycle ”\nShishya who is still in deep thinking while listening asks, ” What if some people move from obligation cycle to responsibility cycle ? ”\n” Still it would be a cycle. The better from the previous one is that; we at-least feel happy whenever those responsibilities are fulfilled in timely manner and cherish those moments ”\n” Which is a better cycle Guruji, such that we cherish all the moments we live in ”\n” You know it. It is the cycle of love. Love your family and yourself. It is neither obligation nor responsibility; but just love. ”\n“ Love leads to attachment which is a hinderance to be in a state of bliss; that you mentioned a while earlier.” mentions shishya with a lot of confusion around his head.\n” Obligation and Responsibility is way of looking the life outside. We will always be in a hurry to fulfil those things so as to find time to be in a state of freedom; which is of-course not possible. Similarly, if love is projected outwards we tend to have an attachment for those outward things; which of-course leads to a cycle; in terms of living it is way better than the other two. ”\nShishya still has that unrest in his mind as he couldn’t find the answer that he is looking for and asks, ” Guruji, you mentioned that the love is projected outwards; Is there something called as ‘love that is projected inwards’ ? ”\n— Continuation in next blog\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nMy previous blogs for reference -\n\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/learnings-indian-culture/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning101/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning102/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning103/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning104/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning105/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning106/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning107/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning108/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning109/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning110/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning111/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning112/"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Time & Tide waits for none. We value our time to such an extent that we are so particular how 24 hours of a day has to be managed. And yet how many times have we felt that a Sunday has gone like a flash. I bet most of us would experience it on every Sunday. And on that very Sunday we stack up so many ToDo list; only to say in the evening to ourselves that “There isn’t enough time!!!”.\nLet us assume in a arbitrary world we had given excess time i.e.; 1 Full Day = 72 Hours. And we have obtained this bonus for 1 complete year. On comparing to real world we now have two bonus years at our perusal. Can we assume that we don’t say to ourselves that “There isn’t enough time!!!”. To our irony, if we do a random survey we would comfortably conclude that there is no significant difference observed with respect to the extra time obtained. Does that mean are we not valuing time???\nThis usually occurs since we do the same things everyday for most part of our time; say for example eating, sleeping, driving and few others. As most of these activities cannot be automated and we feel that other activities have to be done quicker to squeeze time for other future works.\n\nThis situation can be called as a Time Trap as we always experience that Future Time is less than that of Present Time.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn haste, I request not to open an another browser tab and google for “How to manage the time effectively”. You will get a blanket solutions that might not even address the solution for an average human being as these solutions aren’t focused on understanding the problem but provides just an alternative solution in a better presentable way that we already know. Also do remember that time cannot be managed because the time waits for none.\n\nSo fundamental question would be, what goes in our brain that makes TimeTrap to be a vicious circle that can’t be evaded.\n\nAgain i request not to conduct RCTs and show our extra eagerness to find some interaction variables. On the contrary, it all needs introspection.\n\nHow many times: { Usually the 80% of Time Traps }\n\n\nIn our childhood, we would be reading the same chapter {usually the 1st chapter} till our term ends.\nWe would have paid fees for different fitness clubs only to perform workout for few months.\nWe would have read the same novel for over an year as we found half of it is boring.\nWe would have taken same resolutions every new year.\nand so on…\n\nThis doesn’t mean that we are not valuing time. We are valuing so much that we have took extra care for these decisions. However, we don’t finish the activity completely { or don’t do it in full attention}. This is because we are managing the time and trying to squeeze this new activity to take up the other activity. To only make a half cooked activity only to revisit for the next time.\nTo keep the activity in-tact, I feel that the term “milestone” seems to be introduced such that we are motivated about the progress and have a sense of achievement at the end of each mile-stone. This habit usually evades our time killing habit i.e.; revisiting the particular milestone even after its completion as we are progressing for completing the balance milestones for that activity.\nTo conclude, the old age “that a work begin is half done” is still true as it motivates for us to begin a new activity at each period of our life time. However, it is our responsibility to finish it in right way to our fullest ability till its milestones are finished completely."

    "text": "This blog is in continuation of my earlier blog . Click Here\nWorld Food Day is celebrated every year across the world on 16 October which is the founding data of  Food and Agriculture Organisation.\nTheme for 2018 was “Our Actions Are Our Future, Ending World Hunger by 2030 is Possible” which emoted me to write the earlier blog.\nCurrent year theme is “Our Actions Are Our Future, Healthy Diets for A #ZeroHunger World” which gave me an impetus to continue where i left earlier.\nBackground:\n\n\n\n\n\nHunger Index is prepared on three variables:\n\nThe Proportion of Population that doesn’t consume adequate amount of calories\nProportion of Underweight children under the age of five.\nThe mortality rate among children under five years of age, expressed as the percentage of children born alive who die before they reach the age of five.\n\nChina’s GHI is 7 vis-a-vis India is 23.\nIn this article would like to discuss on the below pointers Are we inclined to buy more tastier than nutritious.? Taking full calorie diet is enough - Read the Link on How many calories do you need ? or Should we stop counting Calories and Count Nutrients Instead - Article\nRDA for Calories is between 2000 to 2500 - Link for RDA for Calories and Link for RDA for Nutrients.\nThe biggest challenge these days for government, nutritionists and people is to create a balance between calories and nutrients. As a part of lifestyle most of us would have started consuming nutrition supplement as a part of our daily diet; which is ideally not recommended, as absorption of nutrients from real food would go in a declining phase. [ Some Links - Link1 ; Link2 ]\n\nOn the other side, the interesting fact is that there are more number of obese people in India than starving for hunger. Overweight and obesity kills more people than underweight and act as a predisposing factor for non-communicable diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, musculoskeletal disorders, some cancers.\n\nThe top three reasons for obesity is\n1) Engineering Junk Food\n2) Excessive Food Addiction\n3) Lack of Right Food Availability\n\nLack of Right Food Availability is the common reason for both being obese as well as being in malnutrition and in hidden hunger. We have to agree that stomach full is not equal to nutrient full. The reasons for choosing the tastier or available food can be future cost, savings, current money, craving, necessity and taste.\n\nOur Grand Parents rarely see the locally grown pulses/vegetables being grown by farmers in large quantities. Most know that the reasons for the same has its root from green revolution.\n\nThe challenge for future Industries is also to make Nutrient Dense Foods at a cheaper/best price alternative which will be accessible to all.\n\nTo Conclude:\nEvery one has a role to play to achieve the #ZeroHunger state in this world."

    "text": "Continuing from previous blogs:\nWe have observed where the Rishi who gets enlightened through self inquiry with a true inherent desire to meet the Showman; they would like to come forward to share the similar experience to his few selected disciples; and thus ‘the Rishi’ becomes ‘the Guru’.  Who have created a way for each and everyone of us (In terms of Personal God) to get us liberated and realize the Showman within ourselves. And then we learnt that people who embark a travel to meet the showman are termed as ‘Brahmacharya’; To get motivated to meet the showman they start to pray the Sun who is more visible and tangible; and then continue their path for the ultimate showman.\nRishis Disciple is now in a confusion mode asking about the inner light dualities among the people and again got into confusion when he envisaged that his realization to showman has to be Sacrificed to realize him. His question of “why pooja” made him to realize that it should not be a ritual but a method to concentrate to realize the god.\nWe left the previous blog where Shishya approaches to Guruji and asks , ” If everyone is looking to realize the showman to achieve the state of bliss, Who will do the work Guruji and keep the world running ? ”\nAnd then Rishi/Guru responds in this way: { This answer will be answered through conversations in next three blogs; This is second one - conversation continued from  1) first one 2) second one] }\nGuruji Says, ” What is inward looking according to you? ”\nShishya replies, ” As per my short experience, i would like to say it is about tracing back our thought process and correcting it ”\nGuruji felt happy for his answer and says, ” Very Good. To add on it is ideally having no thought process and seeing the things as it is ”\nShishya from his unrest state moved to confusion state which is vividly visible on his facial expressions. And he enquires Guruji , ” Guruji, How can we don’t have a thought process ”\n” When you achieve that state, you are said to be in a constant connection with the showman. His thought process will become our action. The results of the actions is a reward to his thought process. So, we become his tool to convert his thoughts to action. ”\nAs Shishya is still in confusion mode; Guruji continues, ” Coming to what Inward Journey means; It is the Journey to our Showman. When you are guided by him every moment our life life becomes a blissful journey.”\n” If people don’t get the rewarded; how would they get motivated to do their work on daily basis “  Asks Shishya with a mix of Confusion and Excitement.\n“ LokaSamgraha is what you have mentioned earlier which has to be a consistent acts for generations. For such to happen we have to uncomplicate the life within us; which would only happen when we try to start an inward journey” { This is the Summary for 1) first one 2) second one  }\nAnd Guruji Continues, ” If the act of LokaSamgraha is the thought process of the showman. What more reward do we need it !!! ”\nShishya who was in a state of excitement, suddenly became calm as if a bucket of cold water has been poured on his head.\nAfter a short pause; Shishya says, ” I now understand Guruji, We are just tools to our showman; as you mentioned that the world has been running on its own for millions of years; by the guidance and thought process of Showman itself. We are here to execute his thoughts to fullest extent and make the world more lively for future generations.”\nGuruji Smiled with Satisfaction;\n” Dhanyotsmi Guruji, But how would be know that this is the work of HIS thoughts ? ” Asks Shishya with excitement and love.\n— Answer in next blog\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nMy previous blogs for reference -\n\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/learnings-indian-culture/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning101/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning102/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning103/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning104/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning105/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning106/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning107/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning108/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning109/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning110/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning111/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning112/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning113/"

His question of “why pooja” made him to realize that it should not be a ritual but a method to concentrate to realize the god. Whatever work we do, if we perform as per direction of showman we will attain peace and not thinking about the reward and living out of vicious loop of Gunas.\nNow Shishya is trying to learn about the pains and its conflicts. And has learnt that the conflict is his past image with respect to the present. Also, the conflict will be no more only when one tries to understand the conflict.\nWe left the previous blog with this question.\nShishya started to ponder to what Guruji said and in few minutes he asks, ” If I just live around these conflicts and try to understand them, when can I reach an ultimate bliss situation and realize the showman. I doubt is there a showman in reality ? ”\nAnd then Rishi/Guru responds in this way:\n” Who has created these conflicts? ” asks Guruji.\nShishya, instead of reacting instantly, thinks calmly for a few seconds and responds, ” As you said Guruji, conflicts are created in our mind to our past. So, conflict is our creation. ”\n” If you want to enjoy the conflict! what do you have to do? ”\n” Guruji, that is an absurd question. How can one enjoy the conflict? ”\n” You are not thinking Shishya. Give it a thought you have the answer. ”\nShishya closes his eyes for a minute; and he opens his eyes as if he got enlightened and responds, ” As you have said Guruji, conflict can be reduced when we try to understand the conflict. However, to enjoy the conflict we have to come above the conflict and start loving the process of learning the conflict ”\nGuruji looks so revealed with his answers and smiles happily with a nod.\nGuruji asks again, ” What makes you ponder, that is there a showman in reality or not? ”\n” If there is in reality, you would be describing him and not the path to realizing him. Also, if there is one showman there would not be different religions ”\n” Showman or truth is the same ”\n” I could not comprehend your context, Guruji ”\n” Our goal for showman is to reach a state of ultimate bliss, which in itself is the highest truth ” responds Guruji while sipping water\nand continues, ” Truth remains the same. However, the path to understanding the truth might differ. I teach you my paths and others teach theirs. ”\n” But why does it take so many years for your disciples to realize the truth ? ” asks Shishya instantly\n” If they follow my path, they will understand my truth but not theirs’ ” responds Guruji with a calm and pleasant smile.\nShishya closes his eyes and goes into deep thinking and asks, ” Dhanyotsmi Gurudeva, I understand the starting point of the truth. If I have realized the showman, I have to come above the paths that you mentioned and create my path for him ”\nGuruji nods his head and says, ” A while ago, when I have said to rethink on conflict. Instead of giving up you thought and responded and which is better than my answer. Remember, the entire cosmic is your brain. You have to make it light to make the best use for your happiness ”\nAfter a while, shishya asks, ” What do I have to do after I realize the truth ”\nThis time Guruji replies, ” You stay with the truth ” instantaneously. \n” I understand that Guruji, but what work should I do by staying with the truth for life long other than staying in bliss. Of course, which is our ultimate goal. I mean after reaching the goal what should I do for the rest of my life. ”\n— Answer in next blog\nGlossary:\nUniverse is in your brain\n\nLink for your consumption\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nMy previous blogs for reference -\n\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/learnings-indian-culture/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning101/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning102/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning103/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning104/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning105/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning106/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning107/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning108/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning109/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning110/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning111/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning112/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning113/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning114/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning115/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning116/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning117/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning118/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning119/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning120/"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Any Normal person assumes as in following way for these phrases:\n\nHard-work: A Consistent Effort.\nAchievement: Special Effort.\nSuccess: Accomplishment.\n\nLet me run through a conversation between a father and son. Where the son discovers the interlink between these three phrases and which finally makes him to discover the root for these branches.\nAbout the Roles:\nSon - Let us call him as Arjun for this Blog. He runs a small start-up company let’s say a manufacturing company.\nFather - He is a retired Government Employee. \nConversation:\nFather: “Arjun, How are you doing these days.”\nArjun is too busy in his thinking and unconsciously eating a piece of idly with the fork. It took him half a minute to recognise his fathers voice and then responded in a non-emotive way, “Yeah Dad, I’m doing great. I’m enjoying the morning idly made by mother. It is delicious.”\nAs Mother can understand her child hunger, Father can visualize the internal uneasiness of his child. He continued to observe his sons way of unconscious eating till both of them are done with their breakfast.\n\nAs it was a Sunday, immediately after the breakfast Arjun climbed the stairs and went straight to his room and locked the door.\n\nAfter about a half an hour, sharp multiple trashing sounds are heard from Arjuns’ room. Father immediately shouted “Arjun, Is all well?”. “Yeah Papa, It is just my mobile.”. However, Arjuns’ father is not convinced by the answer; and he responded by knocking the door and said “Beta, Open the door.”\n\nArjun hesitantly opened the door and said “Nothing major happened Papa. I need just a little time.”\nFather came inside the room without any response and occupied the laptop chair with comfort and signaled his child to sit beside him on the bean bag.\n\nArjun locked the door from inside and understood that there would be some discussion with his father so with hesitation sat on the bean bag. His father took his sons’ right hand in his hands and said, “I know you need time. And everyone do need time in need. But only few recognize that they need help. And yet only few would be able to step forward for that little guidance from others. And as you are my only child, it is my utmost love and care on you that i took it as my privilege to ask you - How can i help you my friend.”\n\nArjun with water filled eyes hugged his father immediately and said in a low voice, “I’m loosing the game in all directions. I know this is temporary. But I feel it is heavy; I feel frustrated and dejected and all thoughts are obscured also it seems to me that there is no way ahead.”\n\nHe tapped thrice on his sons back slowly and made him to sit straight on his bean bag and said, “Every one feels in the same way when multiple problems comes at a time. However, most of us forget to ask the most important question - What are we loosing. And what are you loosing my child now.”\n\n”Dad, I’m suffering from high lower level employee attrition. Which is making the project delivery timeliness to stretch and in-turn pushing me to pay for heavy penalties and finally making my profits to shrink. Again, this is putting me under tight pressure to hire the best resource for the job and cycle is getting revolved.”\n\nHis father smiled and said, “I’m asking what are you loosing and not what your company is facing.”\n\nArjun puzzled for a second and said, “If my company is facing problems. Doesn’t it mean that I’m loosing the game?”\n\n“I think you didn’t get me. Let me put the question in an another way. What game are you playing?”\n\nArjun smiled sarcastically and said, “Dad, I think you didn’t get me too. If a company has to run continuously it has be at-least self sustainable. The game I’m playing is make my company sustainable for ever and meet its larger vision & mission.”\n\n“Great!!! Let us keep aside your recent year failures and see your past 10 years consecutive wins in your game. Shall we?”\n\n“Yeah Papa….” said Arjun by slowly taking a sip of water.\n\n”Good! Why do you think you had a success in last 10 years after the company inception.”\n\n”My Targets are comparatively very low than now and we have achieved it successfully by of-course persistent hard-work by the entire team; as we need to prove ourselves in the market that we are the ‘best solution providers’.”\n“Also, we break the larger milestone into smaller milestones which we ensured to achieve such that it provides us a large imputes for barge ahead to bring success for our newbie company.”\n“Also, the said methodologies haven’t changed but I’m loosing the game now.”\n\nHis father smiled happily and said, “It is great that you have spoken on Hard-work, Achievement and Success. You said that by doing hard-work you achieved success and by doing persistent hard-work you achieved multiple achievements that made you to enjoy success for last 10 years. Can I know why did you do hard-work? And what happened when you achieved and how did you feel every time you succeeded?”\n\nArjun responded with a quick smile, “Dad, any one does hard-work to achieve his immediate target. And of course persistent hard-work to achieve his goal which is known to every one. Personally, i can say that when we achieved small milestones it can give us confidence that we can achieve our clients aspirations. Every time me met our client expectations or aspirations we felt proud and happy that our company would become a best solution provider for the companies.”\n\nArjun’s father made his back bone straight for a minute to assimilate his thinking and replied, “So, are you saying that you are working to see the happy faces of your clients?”\n\n“Of course. ‘Customer is King’. If we leave him happy any business would survive.” Swiftly replied Arjun with pride.\n\nHis father gave a mockery smile at his answer and said,“So you and your team is surviving by seeing your clients happiness than fulfilling the needs of your clients.”\n\n“I didn’t get you Papa.”\n\n“Let me explain in a simple way. As a father if I had worried for your happiness I would have not met all your fundamental needs. As per my capacity I created a balance for your needs and happiness. Finally, I was elated when you took a decision of funding your own start-up which I call it as my success.”\n“When I understood the journey for my success, I was always happy and enjoyed each and every step that I took. I seldom cared for the result but never worried because, as I felt that one day there will be a success.”\nHis father took a deep breath and took a sip of water and then continued in a low yet with profound voice.\n“As per my understanding you have defined the company success in yearly goals which might not be a healthy parameter for all the stake holders for being happy in each and every work they do. You might need to create a strong purpose for long term happiness for the company.”\n“I know this is easy to say and tough to practice. But I strongly believe in your competence.”\n\nArjun showed an enlightened face and said, “I understood Dad. So far i was searching the happiness by seeing the final result. And I rarely enjoyed the work that I do; which is the fundamental reason for my frustration.”\n“Also, problems will be there in every journey that we take. If my mood isn’t happy to recognise and understand the problems; I would never have the courage to go ahead to solve them rather would be afraid of them.”\n“Thanks a lot Papa for your guidance as usual. I will take help of my core team to rebuild the solution by laying down the larger case study.”\n\n“You are always welcome, Arjun. Remember I’m always with you!!!”"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Note: This is my personal research and learning project on Epidemic Forecasting for Indian Sub Continent. Only Time will tell how true these models are !!!\nHope the readers are liking the COVID19 blog series. However, my personal learning has helped me to debunk my old thoughts and helped me to create few fresh perspectives.\nOur Earlier Blogs:\n\nCOVID 19 : FACTS & REALTY CHECK - Where I learned about this pandemic - Published on 25th March 2020\nCOVID 19: NETIZEN REACTIONS - Where tried to show case few examples where netizens try to forward without a fact check. - Published on 29th March 2020\nCOVID 19: LESSONS FROM “IN” LAND - Our Learning from Kerala - Published on 5th April 2020.\nCOVID 19 : MEDICAL SCIENCE TO OVERCOME PANDEMIC - My Learning on the Corona Virus on Scientific Terminology. - Published on 15th of April 2020\nCOVID 19: DEATHS , LOCK DOWN & RECESSION - My Opine along with little research on inter relation about the same - Published on 28th of April 2020.\nCOVID 19: FEAR STRESS & SUICIDE - My Opine to high light on the stress and suicide in India SubContinent - Published on 10th of May 2020\n\n________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nAs per rule book of Analytics; I have divided the entire analysis into two parts i.e.;\n\nDescriptive or Exploratory Analytics\nPredictive or Prescriptive Analytics\n\nEntire Coding has been done in “R” and for reproducible research upto Descriptive Analytics is uploaded on GitHub Account is available at https://github.com/arun0710/COVID19. The Visualisation & Results can be viewed at “https://rpubs.com/arun0710/COVID19” for which the results would be updated on daily basis. { The RPubs file is best viewed on Chrome or Opera }\n\nDescriptive or Exploratory Analysis\nThe TimeLine Trend Map will intuitively tell us us where the cases are more and when they started to increase. After Maharashtra being on the top list we can see the it is been followed by Tamil Nadu, Delhi, Gujarath, UP, Rajasthan & Madhya Pradesh.\n\nDisclaimer: Excuse me for the boundaries of the map. These are taken from online sources and the required shape files are uploaded in the github account.\n\n\n\nFig1: Geographic Time-Line Confirmed Cases Trend\n\n\nLog/Linear along with all the states the Log Scale & Linear Scale Graph is built primarily which states are effective in terms of controlling the spread. As we heave been listening in the media; it turned out to be Kerala. However, a small uptick is seen for Kerala recently due to the influx of incoming cases in the state from other states & countries.\nAlso, interestingly Andhra Pradesh states is trying best to flatten the curve.\n\n\n\nFig2: The Log/Linear Graph across the Time-Line to observe & compare across the states\n\n\nWe have been hearing that the testing is low and we need to do more testing in India. Interesting to find that the correlation between daily tests and daily confirmed cases for Over-All India is at 94%. So, it looks like that the only solution as said by WHO is test, trace, isolate & quarantine.\n\n\n\nFig3: Daily Confirmed vs Daily Tests Trend.\n\n\n\nClustering has been done on two dimensions i.e.; Positivity Rate & Confirmed Cases to identify the cluster of states which can be future hotspots. { Maharashtra has been removed from this cluster analysis }. The Green Cluster on the right hand side are the states which might not be doing testing or not be reporting or data not available but there are cases in last 10 days.\n\n\n\nFig4: Cluster Plot to Identify the next HotSpot States\n\n\n\n\nPredictive or Prescriptive Analysis\nEpidomology Forecasting and Simulation is a very challenging and there are high chances to be going wrong as we are dealing with many uncertainties.  \nOne such famous model that has gone wrong is the SIRS Model which has been internalised by SUTD Lab for being over optimistic.  A paper published on April 30th where you can see past graphs. { Link }\n\n\n\nFig5: SUTD Lab- Where they have took their model internal due to over-optimism\n\n\nThere are few planners who has used the model directly in the Indian Scenario without understanding the details of the algorithm. Which is like directly pulling out the data from the open source data and performing forecasting without any context.\n\nThe catch in SIRs model is that it doesn’t take testing into accounting and greater science goes in defining the initial set of variables. However, the model has worked very well with other respiratory diseases where in the disease primarily spreads from symptomatic infections as the initial set of variables are usually can be determined very easily because of symptomatic and verified data.\nThe Model that I am proposing uses the base of SEIR Model and on top-up will be using the test rates, asymptomatic cases and probable under detection to estimate/simulate the susceptible cases which will be improved as more data is available.\n\nBaseModel:\nHere is a base model which uses time-series forecasting on tests and then it regresses on the confirmed cases to forecast the future confirmed cases. As we learnt that higher the tests -&gt; higher the cases.\n\nBelow is the output of base model. Since the testing is increasing and hence the confirmed cases there is chance of trend will show upward when considered time series forecasting. So, the forecast is done only for the next 15 days.\n\n\n\nFig6: Base Forecasting Model Output for next 15 days;\n\n\n\nBelow is the quick summary of predicted output of the base time series forecasting model; This model gives a good estimate of the probable Active Cases and thus the near requirement or preparedness of the hospitalisation cases as per the current trend of testing. { Assumption of hospitalisation is taken only for severe or critical patients }\n\n\n\nFig7: Snapshot of Cases as on 15th Day Predicted by base model\n\n\nModifiedSIRs-Model:\n\nInitial parameters for the SIRS Model for the suspected population is kept for all urban & metro cities and then by past trend it is seen that the testing is 20 times lower than expected based on the simulation trend. { If Testing matches to that of the requirement; considering sufficient beds available for the people; Active Cases curve will flatten itself in 30 days }\n\nAs SIRS Model is being considered as over optimistic the initial set variables play a huge role in terms of arriving at the Infected Individuals. Beta, Gamma is adjusted as per testing and undetected cases.\n\nAlso, Active Cases is arrived as the present recovery trend instead to using SIRS Model.\n\nNote: There might be few changes as we learn during the pandemic course. The suggested model would certainly undergo changes on weekly basis.\n\n\n\nFig8: Adjusted SIRS Model Output for Next 40 Days\n\n\n\n\n\nFig9: Quick Summary of Adjusted SIRs Model for 15th, 30th & 40th Day\n\n\nFinal Commentary:\n\nNote: Although the total detected cases are in upward; 80% of the present detected cases with our testing rate are asymptomatic.\nAs mentioned in all previous blogs - Corona will certainly go away it is just a matter of time which can be more quicker with national integrity and global solidarity. Also, earlier couple of blogs on total deaths and suicides are discussed to zoom out of view for a better perspective and comprehension of present situation.\nPredicting an END for Pandemic is difficult; as any future outbreak/epidemic is more likely if dealt with wrong hands. So, it is high time to adjust with the new normal with lockdown mindset. And further as we are moving to unlock 1.0 to save our own livelihoods it is fundamental necessity to practice the new social norms to save our own people at-least till the availability of vaccine.\nWe have learnt that there are only three ways to control this pandemic in India\n\nPeoples’ Participation\nTesting, Testing & More Testing\nTracing, Isolation & Quartine\n\nhttps://www.erinbromage.com/post/the-risks-know-them-avoid-them a viral blog post which is on Whatsapp and twitter.

He could hardly see the traffic through his misty eyes and, in an unmindful state, pulled out the mobile from his left pocket and dialled his friend Raj.\n“Raj, can you come ASAP to our regular hangout place?”\nBeing his thickest friend from the last year, he understood the situation, felt his necessity, and said, “Sure, Sanjay. I will reach in a couple of minutes. Will be waiting for you.”\nCar brushed the median strip and gained a dent in the rear door. However, Sanjay’s current emotions made him pay little attention to this improvement, and without stopping anywhere else, he reached the hangout place in ten minutes.\n“Raj, can you help to order a cup of fresh ginger tea for me, please”\nRaj went to the stall, which is adjacent to the bakery, And in ten minutes, he came with two cups of tea and placed them on the lawn seat.\n“Sanjay, what happened? Why do you look so dull? Is it about Swathi?”\nSanjay behaved as if he lived too emotionally mature and could handle things efficiently.\n“Yes”, said he and then sipped the hot tea and continued, ” she ditched me. she said she is seeing another *ss**le”.\n“How can she do it to me, Raj? I have been with her for two years and have always given her enough space for her privacy. So is that the mistake I made?”\nIn anguish, he sipped the entire hot tea in a couple of gulps and continued, “Nevertheless, I can handle this. I will consider this moment as a blip in my personal life.”\nMeanwhile, Raj’s phone vibrated, and slowly he picked up the phone from his right pocket and texted - “He is with me will call you later.”\n“Raj, are u seeing a girl too?”\nRaj responded with a shy smile and said, “Yes.”\n“Be aware, Raj. Take me as an example. Never trust these girls blindly. For example, see how cruel Swathi is… First, she kissed me, and now she is ready to kiss another one…”\n“Sanjay, be kind to her. She is your girlfriend”.\n“You are right, Raj. But it isn’t any more”is”. It is her choice—preferences changes as time matures. We have to respect the same. So let it go, man.”\nThey chatted about office politics for the next half an hour and departed.\nSanjay reached the home safely and texted the same to Raj. Then, after having a good dinner with his parents, he went to his room and locked the room tightly and cried like a baby and slept off.\nFor the next month, he posted many motivational messages on social media and got numerous likes, ultimately leading to a boost in his self-esteem.\nOne fine working day, he took off from work and went to the theatre to watch a movie to ease his work pressures. Just before the interval, he spotted Raj and Swathi in upper corner seats, having their love time.\nDuring the interval, Sanjay encountered them at the snack area, smiled, and responded, “Hey guys, hope you are having a lovely time together. Your pair is heavenly.”\nSwathi understood his internal sarcasm and said, “I hope you are fine with our relationship.”\n“Yea.Yea. Yeah… I am much stronger now. I have a huge career in front of me, which is more important than anything else.”\nSanjay acted as if he got a text message and said, “Guys, you have to carry on. I have to leave for work now. I just got an emergency text.” and immediately left the place with hidden frustration.\nAgain in the night, after his dinner, he went to his room and cried like a baby and slept off.\nAfter thinking for a long time, he jotted down three questions, which he felt he get answers to immediately in order to reduce his worries and improve his self-esteem.\n  1) Why is this always happening to me?\n  2) Whom should I trust? \n  3) How much can I trust someone?\nHe turned to his miniature electronic device to get the answers, which re-directed him to consult a psychotherapist.\nWith the aid of the Practo App, he booked a top-rated psychotherapist who, in turn, practices far away from his home.\nWithout procrastination, he quickly drove to the place post the appointment confirmation.\nAfter entering the consultant’s room, he realised that the therapist was none other than Swathi’s mother.\nHis brain triggered his famous question, “How Much I Can Trust Her?….”\n&lt;&lt;&lt; To be Continued &gt;&gt;&gt;\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________"

    "section": "",
    "text": "This fourteen letter word indeed plays a major role in our life. Because each and every situation that we face in our life we need to play our role with cent percent involvement and responsible for the consequences for that situation. \nThis time I will try to explain the prime importance of this fourteen letter word with the help of a story. Hope you will like it.\nNarration type-&gt; First person.\nI feel the beads of on my forehead although the temperature in the room is 18oC. I’m neither preparing for exams nor I was caught doing something bizarre ;). It’s about a delivery that needs to be delivered to the customer that has already been delayed by 120 minutes. Time is now 9:00 A.M and I’m completely famished.\nI heard a sweet lovely voice, when I was in this horrendous task, and it says “Hi, can you help me with this?”\nI know she is cute and sweet and had it been on a normal day I would have explained the complete history of the work that she was asking but now it’s the wrong time and in haste I replied in my usual manner “ Sorry !!!, ask someone else or come later. I’m not free now.”\nEveryone around me felt that I was rude but I hope that situation understanding will condone my behaviour.\nDelivery went on smoothly and finally our customer got satisfied when his customer got satisfied but on the other side she is unhappy. I took that as a trade off as I felt that one should be more responsible to their work rather than relationship with co-worker.\nNow it is 4:00 P.M in the evening, I stuck to my four wheeled chair for quarter a day and my spine is aching and sending signals to my grey matter to shut down the computer and get up. Finally I decided to delegate my work to my legs and slowly I took them towards the window glass and pulled down the curtain. Evening sun rays pierced the windows and landed on my eyes and boosted my mitochondria, all of a sudden I felt I saw a new world. Then slowly I asked Sun god to forgive me for showing off my back to him. Now I have seen two eye balls with more fierce and warm than that of the sun. I felt that I should go to her desk and ask whether she need any help but on the contrary I decided to evade as she is in need of help she should approach me.\nSlowly the day faded away.\nNext morning I kept on my soul in my banal work and completely involved to give an error free delivery. Suddenly those fierce eye balls flashed to my memory and I came to normal world and shook my head with smile and got up from my seat to see what she is doing now. But she isn’t there at her place and it happened for next one week. Through group manager I came to know that she is suffering from typhoid and will be coming to office in coming week.\nFrom that instant; my mind created interest on her which finally led me to search for her on Facebook and sent a request to be a friend with her. Within few hours she responded the request and we started chatting together and it ended on that with exchange of our numbers. On that day I felt like flying up in the air as I was feeling more confidence, that I can accomplish anything in this world.\nIn next few days we got closer; most interesting is that we never spoke face to face but only through sms. Ice broke between us when on one day she called me late night and lately after an hour of chat, “I proposed her”. In response to my request for proposal she cut down the call and texted me for the reason for my act. I know there is no one on this earth who can give a perfect reason, at that time I thought I was too intelligent than her and I tried to justify my proposal through various ways; As usual she wasn’t pleased with anything.\nNext day when I woke up early morning I realised the mistake I have done last night. But as I had proposed her I felt that it was my responsibility to commit myself to my act and for my words. Everyone knows that no one proposes to a girl in two weeks of their acquaintance unless it’s love at first sight. I thought that I should either say her that it was cent percent infatuation and went to office in the same notion when I was about to swipe my card into my zone; I received a text saying. “I think you are serious. I know you love me; but how can I perceive it unless you show it to me?”\nI was dumb struck to respond to that text. As came to office with a different notion and that sms was a bolt out of blue. So, finally I said to myself that she will be my wife as I felt it is the only way to be more responsible for what I have done. I replied to that text saying that you will feel it in near future. But I know that my decision is abrupt and I don’t have any logical conclusion as how I could have decide about my better half without even completely getting to know about her; A lot of questions popped up in my mind however I struck to my decision that she is my wife for this life.\n\nAlso, I felt that I love her truly with my cent percent emotions. Then I started to show her these emotions to her and she got confirmed that I was very true to her and accepted my proposal and in few months we got married.\nAfter reading the story you may come to a conclusion that this story doesn’t go along with the title.\n\nBut however if you observe the act he has been doing be it be in his work life or in his personal life he felt that his actions and the consequences of his action for which he is responsible is his responsibility. So, he held to himself that he is responsible albeit no one questioned to him. This is so because he constantly questioning to himself and tried to be as true as possible to himself. Similarly… { How can we decide about our better half in match-looking after speaking to them in quick time. But marriages, culture and authenticity sustained }\nAs we have age old adage “Necessity is the mother of invention”. Finally, I would like to complete the article by saying that “Responsibility is the father of fraternity”."

And then we learnt that people who embark a travel to meet the showman are termed as ‘Brahmacharya’; To get motivated to meet the showman they start to pray the Sun who is more visible and tangible; and then continue their path for the ultimate showman.\nRishis Disciple is now in a confusion mode asking about the inner light dualities among the people and again got into confusion when he envisaged that his realization to showman has to be Sacrificed to realize him. His question of “why pooja” made him to realize that it should not be a ritual but a method to concentrate to realize the god.\nWe left the previous blog where Shishya nods his head and answers, ” Yes, i now understood that if i pray for the sake of prayer; the purpose is lost; and it becomes just as a mere activity instead a purposeful ritual ” And Shishya thinks to himself and asks again , ” Then why so many festivals are brought into our society, Guruji. Certainly those doesn’t look like methods; It looks more like a celebration. Can you please enlighten me ”\nAnd then Rishi/Guru responds in this way:\n” Have you seen those fishes swim by in that river pond ? ”\n” Many times Guruji !!! ”\n” Luckily we didn’t see them celebrating festivals right ? ”\nShishya with an argumentative facial expression said, ” they either don’t pray as well ! ”\nGuruji smiled as said, ” May be they don’t pray like us ”\n” In the same way, they might not be celebrating festivals like us. This can also be true Guruji ”\n” Very true. How do they celebrate then ? ”\nShishya went from argumentative facial expression to thinking facial expression and said, ” Guruji, as i have mentioned, i didn’t see the way they celebrate like us. But i have seen them playing and at times in beautiful patterns”\n” It is very lovely to see them playing. Do you see any time pattern in their play.”\n” I feel they play when ever they like to; Am i right Guruji ”\n” Yes, luckily fishes don’t behave like adult humans; they are not given instructions for playing. Fishes love to have fun and play is one such method for them to be in fun mode. When we are kids we have a lots of fun by ourselves, but when we start growing older we search for fun in our life. ”\n” Guruji, are you saying festivals are like instructions for us to play together ”\nGuruji sat down under the tree shade and asked his Shishya to sit down and said , “  Hope you agree that everyone of us would like to realize the god. However, most of them due to their work ( karma ) might not be in a position to be continuously in touch with our showman, although there is a way”\nShishya is eagerly listening and has said nothing\nGuruji continued, ” Long Ago, a highly intellectual Guruji and his disciples has seen that many of us are in a rat race of life and are in trouble to find enough fun for years. So, they almost created a festival( as a norm) a month as a reason for being fun. To sustain that fun for future generations and ages, they tied up with rituals which were headed by our showman itself ”\n” This is one example of LokaSamgraha which you were trying to discuss with me a while earlier “  \nShishya kept his head down and got completely engrossed in his own train of thoughts\nGuruji continued with a smile on his face, ” If we are still trying to have fun. When can we be in a state of bliss !!! ”\nShishya slowly moved his head upwards with his forehead muscles relaxed and said, ” Dhanyotsmi Gurji!!! ”\nAfter few ghatikas , Shishya approached again to Guruji and asked , ” If everyone is looking to realize the showman to achieve the state of bliss, Who will do the work Guruji and keep the world running ? ”\n— Answer in next blogs\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nNote: Each festival has its own unique story to celebrate and be joyful which we are well aware of it. :)\nMy previous blogs for reference -\n\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/learnings-indian-culture/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning101/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning102/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning103/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning104/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning105/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning106/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning107/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning108/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning109/\nhttps://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning110/"

    "text": "Knight G1 to F3 is usually considered as an aggressive opening move in chess. Beginners usually get alerted when the opponent begins his game with this step.\nDoes it has a distinctive advantage!!!!\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen i asked couple of my friends, they clearly said that it may help; but the core of the game lies in how we manage and control the centre of the board.\nUsually I consider Chess as a high cerebral game as we need to calculate several permutations ahead ( say at-least for two steps ahead ) to take incharge of the chessboard. When there is no first move advantage then why to grope our heads in making the move first! (or) if someone is ahead because of his first move ; Core game is to take incharge on game and not on first right move.\nIf we extend this to a society setting; it makes no such difference. I have myself experienced where-in i have changed my opine about a person after framing my first impression ( I bet most of you would have too ). Still we dwell so much on how to create a first best impression as there is an existing belief i.e.; first best impression will be a lasting impression.\nNote: The First Impressions might be good if the situation is a transient like an interview on a business pitch in an elevator descent etc.; However, there are many cases we would have listened these days that job fitment or business value proposition rules in either of the places than the invisible or intangible first impression we want to create.\nThis has been an interesting thought process that came to my mind today; Hope you may add or refute to the thought process.\nWhy to worry on the invisible/intangible tool if that doesn’t fit in your toolkit?\nTo Conclude, It is both the means and the end goal that matters and not either of them or nor the milestones flagships."

Can you give up your life for LokaSamgraha if that is what our showman asks for? ”\nShishya gets perplexed and in confusion still asks\n” If showman gives us this life; why would he asks us to take away our own life? ”\nGuruji continues …\n” You said above ones because most of them sacrifice or give up these things for a small time to achieve what they want and then they resume back ”\n” Also, Sacrifice is mis-interpreted like giving up another life ( bali ) which is completely erroneous ”\n” Now, as you always say, your vision as a Brahmacarya is to realize showman which is usually a larger than your life goal. Isn’t it ? ”\n” Ideally, you have to Sacrifice something larger than your life! As Showman has give you this life after all ”\nShishya gets curious and asks Guruji.. ” What is that Guruji..? ”\n” Your most awaiting answer is that - You have to Sacrifice that you will realize showman but still pursue the path of Brahmacarya!!! Can you do this? “ { As realizing showman is larger than his life goal }\n” Guruji, if this is the case when do i realize him and be in constant touch with him ? ”\nGurji smiles and starts walking towards river and says - ” Sacrifice ; you can realize him everywhere ”\nShishya shouts and asks..\n” Then why do we give naivedyam ( नैवेद्यम, నైవేద్యం) to our personal god and do pooja; when Sacrificing is a tool for realizing him?”\n— Answer in next blog\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________"

Am I near in framing the right problem statement ? “, Guruji responded with Smile.\nShishya said, ” Yes “, with confusion at heart.\n” In your point of reference, those actions are not acceptable and thus it is hurting you. What happens if your point of reference for those actions are wrong ? ”\nShishya reacted by saying, ” It is a possibility. ”\nGuruji said, ” So, you are saying that your happiness is married on someone actions rather than with the realization of Showman ? ”\nShishya calmed his senses and asked, ” I understood where this is leading to. What if we change the point of reference i.e.; if my actions are hurting others ? ”\nGuruji said, ” If you are asking this question. I’m assuming that you are in a profession that hurts others like say in war/parenting etc.;. On the other side, if you are hurting someone passionately and acting modestly with the same person is a hypocritical living. ”\nShishya nodded his head as a signal to continue.\n” Conflict arise in our mind, when our thinking reference dilly-dallying in our mind.

It is such a lovely thought to be keep it sustained for-ever. The challenge is to keep the positive energy sustained that spreads around them.\nI am going to narrate a conversation excerpt between my father and me.\nDad: How are you, my boy? Arun: I am doing good!!! Dad. Very excited to get married. Dad: I am going to share my experience with you. Hope it might be helpful to you.\nIn a new relationship, each-other expectations would be in two parallel lines. Both of them would get worried to see and digest the others expectations.\nThe two parallel lines can never meet and there will be a strain in the relationship. The beauty lies in the meeting point of the two lines which can happen when both of them lower their expectations and change as per others expectation (few of them ). Because we are humans and not super humans.\nEarlier I thought lowering our expectation is a compromise. But if our relationship prospers and doesn’t compromise because of our compromise. Then what is the wrong in getting compromised? Compromising is not about lowering ourselves. It is about respecting the others limitations as well. Once, we understanding this equation; i feel we respect others opine and start reaching to their expectation as well. If Trust is the positive energy that gels between them; then the compromise acts like a protection shield that embraces the trust. Then truly love is in the air for-ever.\nNote: The most common reason for stress and anxiety these days is because we are having a tough time to make a trustful relationship for longer duration leading to ‘lack of belongingness’."
