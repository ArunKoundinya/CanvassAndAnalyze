    "text": "This fourteen letter word indeed plays a major role in our life. Because each and every situation that we face in our life we need to play our role with cent percent involvement and responsible for the consequences for that situation. \nThis time I will try to explain the prime importance of this fourteen letter word with the help of a story. Hope you will like it.\nNarration type-&gt; First person.\nI feel the beads of on my forehead although the temperature in the room is 18oC. I’m neither preparing for exams nor I was caught doing something bizarre ;). It’s about a delivery that needs to be delivered to the customer that has already been delayed by 120 minutes. Time is now 9:00 A.M and I’m completely famished.\nI heard a sweet lovely voice, when I was in this horrendous task, and it says “Hi, can you help me with this?”\nI know she is cute and sweet and had it been on a normal day I would have explained the complete history of the work that she was asking but now it’s the wrong time and in haste I replied in my usual manner “ Sorry !!!, ask someone else or come later. I’m not free now.”\nEveryone around me felt that I was rude but I hope that situation understanding will condone my behaviour.\nDelivery went on smoothly and finally our customer got satisfied when his customer got satisfied but on the other side she is unhappy. I took that as a trade off as I felt that one should be more responsible to their work rather than relationship with co-worker.\nNow it is 4:00 P.M in the evening, I stuck to my four wheeled chair for quarter a day and my spine is aching and sending signals to my grey matter to shut down the computer and get up. Finally I decided to delegate my work to my legs and slowly I took them towards the window glass and pulled down the curtain. Evening sun rays pierced the windows and landed on my eyes and boosted my mitochondria, all of a sudden I felt I saw a new world. Then slowly I asked Sun god to forgive me for showing off my back to him. Now I have seen two eye balls with more fierce and warm than that of the sun. I felt that I should go to her desk and ask whether she need any help but on the contrary I decided to evade as she is in need of help she should approach me.\nSlowly the day faded away.\nNext morning I kept on my soul in my banal work and completely involved to give an error free delivery. Suddenly those fierce eye balls flashed to my memory and I came to normal world and shook my head with smile and got up from my seat to see what she is doing now. But she isn’t there at her place and it happened for next one week. Through group manager I came to know that she is suffering from typhoid and will be coming to office in coming week.\nFrom that instant; my mind created interest on her which finally led me to search for her on Facebook and sent a request to be a friend with her. Within few hours she responded the request and we started chatting together and it ended on that with exchange of our numbers. On that day I felt like flying up in the air as I was feeling more confidence, that I can accomplish anything in this world.\nIn next few days we got closer; most interesting is that we never spoke face to face but only through sms. Ice broke between us when on one day she called me late night and lately after an hour of chat, “I proposed her”. In response to my request for proposal she cut down the call and texted me for the reason for my act. I know there is no one on this earth who can give a perfect reason, at that time I thought I was too intelligent than her and I tried to justify my proposal through various ways; As usual she wasn’t pleased with anything.\nNext day when I woke up early morning I realised the mistake I have done last night. But as I had proposed her I felt that it was my responsibility to commit myself to my act and for my words. Everyone knows that no one proposes to a girl in two weeks of their acquaintance unless it’s love at first sight. I thought that I should either say her that it was cent percent infatuation and went to office in the same notion when I was about to swipe my card into my zone; I received a text saying. “I think you are serious. I know you love me; but how can I perceive it unless you show it to me?”\nI was dumb struck to respond to that text. As came to office with a different notion and that sms was a bolt out of blue. So, finally I said to myself that she will be my wife as I felt it is the only way to be more responsible for what I have done. I replied to that text saying that you will feel it in near future. But I know that my decision is abrupt and I don’t have any logical conclusion as how I could have decide about my better half without even completely getting to know about her; A lot of questions popped up in my mind however I struck to my decision that she is my wife for this life.\n\nAlso, I felt that I love her truly with my cent percent emotions. Then I started to show her these emotions to her and she got confirmed that I was very true to her and accepted my proposal and in few months we got married.\nAfter reading the story you may come to a conclusion that this story doesn’t go along with the title.\n\nBut however if you observe the act he has been doing be it be in his work life or in his personal life he felt that his actions and the consequences of his action for which he is responsible is his responsibility. So, he held to himself that he is responsible albeit no one questioned to him. This is so because he constantly questioning to himself and tried to be as true as possible to himself. Similarly… { How can we decide about our better half in match-looking after speaking to them in quick time. But marriages, culture and authenticity sustained }\nAs we have age old adage “Necessity is the mother of invention”. Finally, I would like to complete the article by saying that “Responsibility is the father of fraternity”."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Any Normal person assumes as in following way for these phrases:\n\nHard-work: A Consistent Effort.\nAchievement: Special Effort.\nSuccess: Accomplishment.\n\nLet me run through a conversation between a father and son. Where the son discovers the interlink between these three phrases and which finally makes him to discover the root for these branches.\nAbout the Roles:\nSon - Let us call him as Arjun for this Blog. He runs a small start-up company let’s say a manufacturing company.\nFather - He is a retired Government Employee. \nConversation:\nFather: “Arjun, How are you doing these days.”\nArjun is too busy in his thinking and unconsciously eating a piece of idly with the fork. It took him half a minute to recognise his fathers voice and then responded in a non-emotive way, “Yeah Dad, I’m doing great. I’m enjoying the morning idly made by mother. It is delicious.”\nAs Mother can understand her child hunger, Father can visualize the internal uneasiness of his child. He continued to observe his sons way of unconscious eating till both of them are done with their breakfast.\n\nAs it was a Sunday, immediately after the breakfast Arjun climbed the stairs and went straight to his room and locked the door.\n\nAfter about a half an hour, sharp multiple trashing sounds are heard from Arjuns’ room. Father immediately shouted “Arjun, Is all well?”. “Yeah Papa, It is just my mobile.”. However, Arjuns’ father is not convinced by the answer; and he responded by knocking the door and said “Beta, Open the door.”\n\nArjun hesitantly opened the door and said “Nothing major happened Papa. I need just a little time.”\nFather came inside the room without any response and occupied the laptop chair with comfort and signaled his child to sit beside him on the bean bag.\n\nArjun locked the door from inside and understood that there would be some discussion with his father so with hesitation sat on the bean bag. His father took his sons’ right hand in his hands and said, “I know you need time. And everyone do need time in need. But only few recognize that they need help. And yet only few would be able to step forward for that little guidance from others. And as you are my only child, it is my utmost love and care on you that i took it as my privilege to ask you - How can i help you my friend.”\n\nArjun with water filled eyes hugged his father immediately and said in a low voice, “I’m loosing the game in all directions. I know this is temporary. But I feel it is heavy; I feel frustrated and dejected and all thoughts are obscured also it seems to me that there is no way ahead.”\n\nHe tapped thrice on his sons back slowly and made him to sit straight on his bean bag and said, “Every one feels in the same way when multiple problems comes at a time. However, most of us forget to ask the most important question - What are we loosing. And what are you loosing my child now.”\n\n”Dad, I’m suffering from high lower level employee attrition. Which is making the project delivery timeliness to stretch and in-turn pushing me to pay for heavy penalties and finally making my profits to shrink. Again, this is putting me under tight pressure to hire the best resource for the job and cycle is getting revolved.”\n\nHis father smiled and said, “I’m asking what are you loosing and not what your company is facing.”\n\nArjun puzzled for a second and said, “If my company is facing problems. Doesn’t it mean that I’m loosing the game?”\n\n“I think you didn’t get me. Let me put the question in an another way. What game are you playing?”\n\nArjun smiled sarcastically and said, “Dad, I think you didn’t get me too. If a company has to run continuously it has be at-least self sustainable. The game I’m playing is make my company sustainable for ever and meet its larger vision & mission.”\n\n“Great!!! Let us keep aside your recent year failures and see your past 10 years consecutive wins in your game. Shall we?”\n\n“Yeah Papa….” said Arjun by slowly taking a sip of water.\n\n”Good! Why do you think you had a success in last 10 years after the company inception.”\n\n”My Targets are comparatively very low than now and we have achieved it successfully by of-course persistent hard-work by the entire team; as we need to prove ourselves in the market that we are the ‘best solution providers’.”\n“Also, we break the larger milestone into smaller milestones which we ensured to achieve such that it provides us a large imputes for barge ahead to bring success for our newbie company.”\n“Also, the said methodologies haven’t changed but I’m loosing the game now.”\n\nHis father smiled happily and said, “It is great that you have spoken on Hard-work, Achievement and Success. You said that by doing hard-work you achieved success and by doing persistent hard-work you achieved multiple achievements that made you to enjoy success for last 10 years. Can I know why did you do hard-work? And what happened when you achieved and how did you feel every time you succeeded?”\n\nArjun responded with a quick smile, “Dad, any one does hard-work to achieve his immediate target. And of course persistent hard-work to achieve his goal which is known to every one. Personally, i can say that when we achieved small milestones it can give us confidence that we can achieve our clients aspirations. Every time me met our client expectations or aspirations we felt proud and happy that our company would become a best solution provider for the companies.”\n\nArjun’s father made his back bone straight for a minute to assimilate his thinking and replied, “So, are you saying that you are working to see the happy faces of your clients?”\n\n“Of course. ‘Customer is King’. If we leave him happy any business would survive.” Swiftly replied Arjun with pride.\n\nHis father gave a mockery smile at his answer and said,“So you and your team is surviving by seeing your clients happiness than fulfilling the needs of your clients.”\n\n“I didn’t get you Papa.”\n\n“Let me explain in a simple way. As a father if I had worried for your happiness I would have not met all your fundamental needs. As per my capacity I created a balance for your needs and happiness. Finally, I was elated when you took a decision of funding your own start-up which I call it as my success.”\n“When I understood the journey for my success, I was always happy and enjoyed each and every step that I took. I seldom cared for the result but never worried because, as I felt that one day there will be a success.”\nHis father took a deep breath and took a sip of water and then continued in a low yet with profound voice.\n“As per my understanding you have defined the company success in yearly goals which might not be a healthy parameter for all the stake holders for being happy in each and every work they do. You might need to create a strong purpose for long term happiness for the company.”\n“I know this is easy to say and tough to practice. But I strongly believe in your competence.”\n\nArjun showed an enlightened face and said, “I understood Dad. So far i was searching the happiness by seeing the final result. And I rarely enjoyed the work that I do; which is the fundamental reason for my frustration.”\n“Also, problems will be there in every journey that we take. If my mood isn’t happy to recognise and understand the problems; I would never have the courage to go ahead to solve them rather would be afraid of them.”\n“Thanks a lot Papa for your guidance as usual. I will take help of my core team to rebuild the solution by laying down the larger case study.”\n\n“You are always welcome, Arjun. Remember I’m always with you!!!”"

    "title": "Not Enough Time Trap!!!",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Time & Tide waits for none. We value our time to such an extent that we are so particular how 24 hours of a day has to be managed. And yet how many times have we felt that a Sunday has gone like a flash. I bet most of us would experience it on every Sunday. And on that very Sunday we stack up so many ToDo list; only to say in the evening to ourselves that “There isn’t enough time!!!”.\nLet us assume in a arbitrary world we had given excess time i.e.; 1 Full Day = 72 Hours. And we have obtained this bonus for 1 complete year. On comparing to real world we now have two bonus years at our perusal. Can we assume that we don’t say to ourselves that “There isn’t enough time!!!”. To our irony, if we do a random survey we would comfortably conclude that there is no significant difference observed with respect to the extra time obtained. Does that mean are we not valuing time???\nThis usually occurs since we do the same things everyday for most part of our time; say for example eating, sleeping, driving and few others. As most of these activities cannot be automated and we feel that other activities have to be done quicker to squeeze time for other future works.\n\nThis situation can be called as a Time Trap as we always experience that Future Time is less than that of Present Time.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn haste, I request not to open an another browser tab and google for “How to manage the time effectively”. You will get a blanket solutions that might not even address the solution for an average human being as these solutions aren’t focused on understanding the problem but provides just an alternative solution in a better presentable way that we already know. Also do remember that time cannot be managed because the time waits for none.\n\nSo fundamental question would be, what goes in our brain that makes TimeTrap to be a vicious circle that can’t be evaded.\n\nAgain i request not to conduct RCTs and show our extra eagerness to find some interaction variables. On the contrary, it all needs introspection.\n\nHow many times: { Usually the 80% of Time Traps }\n\n\nIn our childhood, we would be reading the same chapter {usually the 1st chapter} till our term ends.\nWe would have paid fees for different fitness clubs only to perform workout for few months.\nWe would have read the same novel for over an year as we found half of it is boring.\nWe would have taken same resolutions every new year.\nand so on…\n\nThis doesn’t mean that we are not valuing time. We are valuing so much that we have took extra care for these decisions. However, we don’t finish the activity completely { or don’t do it in full attention}. This is because we are managing the time and trying to squeeze this new activity to take up the other activity. To only make a half cooked activity only to revisit for the next time.\nTo keep the activity in-tact, I feel that the term “milestone” seems to be introduced such that we are motivated about the progress and have a sense of achievement at the end of each mile-stone. This habit usually evades our time killing habit i.e.; revisiting the particular milestone even after its completion as we are progressing for completing the balance milestones for that activity.\nTo conclude, the old age “that a work begin is half done” is still true as it motivates for us to begin a new activity at each period of our life time. However, it is our responsibility to finish it in right way to our fullest ability till its milestones are finished completely."

    "text": "Long back I have read an Antharyami article in “Eenadu” NewsPaper { Largest circulated newspaper in AndhraPradesh & Telangana\nLink: https://www.eenadu.net/newsdetails/16/2019/02/10/30522/Karmayogam\nIn this blog i’m here to present a view that has its root in the above mentioned article. Hope you will like it.\nThis is a conversation between a Psychotherapist and an young software programmer in their third sitting.\nPsychotherapist - Anupuma Programmer - Kid\nKid:  Good Evening Ma’am.\nAnupuma: Good Evening. You look better now. It is been almost couple of months since we meet. How have you been doing.\nKid: I’m doing good. Also, I’m getting better with myself.\nAnupuma: Good to hear this from you. Kid: Can I ask you one thing frankly. Anupuma: Yes… Continue Please. Kid: Although we spend so much effort in the right direction. Why there is failure? Anupuma: Why there has to be a success??\nKid gave a confused look and asked again - “Success is prime, that keeps motivated to go ahead. Isn’t it right?”\n“Well, Well, Well; Of course that does. However when i asked why there has to be success”, She paused and took a sip of water and continued,“I’m mentioning about the outcome.” “Dear, Success or Failure is a binary output variable for the work we do. Do you expect that you should have only ‘success’ in your life and not the failure?”\n“I don’t mean it Ma’am. I was saying that when we give our 100 percent effort to our fullest abilities and we know that we reached the goal. We expect a success and not a failure?”\n“That is good.”\n“You mean failure is good”.\nShe smiled and came beside him and said, ” I mean about effort and the fact that you know that you reached your goal. It is a success for you.”\n“If there isn’t anyone who would recognise it and take it forward. It is a pain. And what would I do with that success”\n\n“Let me clarify it my dear. There is a great difference between effort, performance, accomplishment and assessment”, she got up and took the black marker and drawn a movie film projector and the screen.\nShe continued, ” You remember the old movies. How they used to play. Unlike the digital projection now a days. A film is rolled and gets projected on the silver screen by aid of the projector.\nOur brain projects what is in our schema.\nIn your scenario. your film projected that - since you did great effort and provided exemplary performance and you did accomplish that you feel. The assessment towards it should get added to make it a complete success.\n\nIsn’t it so?”\nKid has gone into his deep thinking by trying to visualise and compare the set of events that has happened to him so far. And nodded the head.\nAnupuma continued, ” Also, you have tied your happiness with the complete success. Although you spent so much energy and effort you are unable to appreciate yourself.”\n“Can you explain me with a better example Ma’am. Am Unable to decipher what you are trying to say.”\n“Assume that you want to participate in 100m running race. So, get into participation you practice a lot, change your diet habits which is your effort. Say you want to finish the race in 15 seconds. You ran very well during the race and finished the race in say 14 seconds. This is called your performance and accomplishment. Now say that you finished 3rd as the 1st and 2nd runner finished in 13.40 & 13.50 seconds respectively. Finally this is your assessment part where you have to assess on how to finish the next race on number 1 spot.” “If you tie up the happiness with the assessment part. It will lead to stress and disappointment.” “Also, event the top most cricket team as well loose matches; although they have best players in their team or how best they perform. However, the team assess on how to win the next match. The team morale will goes down if they go in virtuous cycle of stress and disappointment.”\nAnupuma paused for a minute and allowed the kid to digest the example and continued, “Happiness is not a by product. It is a celebration of you being in the journey of your life”\n“Thanks a lot Ma’am. I think i got a new contrary evidence to my schema which will help me to change my habits.”\n\n“Come in fifteen days dear.”\n“Sure Ma’am. Thanks a lot”.\nI would like to end the article by saying that - LIVING is a present form speech. So, we have to be “In Present” while living.\n\nNote: It doesn’t mean we should not have future plans. I recommend that we should not spoil our journey path for future."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Cambridge Dictionary says: Fear = an unpleasant emotion or thought that you have when you are frightened or worried by something dangerous, painful, or bad that is happening or might happen.\nStress = great worry caused by a difficult situation,\nLet us go through a similar conversation as we read in our previous post. However, this time the conversation is between two close friends who are planning to get married.\nThe below described scenario is a very simple where most of the youngsters might have experienced at-least once.\nAbout the Roles:\nVidhya - A Civil Engineer Graduate working in a Government Company for last one and half year.\nRavi - Final Year Engineering Student. { Who got placed in Apple Company in Bangalore }\n————————————————————————————————————————————————————–\nIt is 4:00 P.M. of 31st Oct 2017\nRavi, who is in quick term gap for a week, is waiting near the entrance of Prasadz Multiplex for his love. Being Monday it is always tough for any working person to leave early from Office and the same is for Vidhya.\n\nRavi waved hand at her when she was stepping out of Auto Rickshaw. And he went till entrance gate of the Multiplex to receive his love.\n\n“Kya huva Madam ji, you called me so urgently from college.” asked Ravi eagerly by placing his left hand over her shoulder and drawing her closer to his body.\n\nVidhya with her left hand took away his hand softly and said, “We are in public darling!!!”\n\n“This sounds very new to me dear. It seems my lady had a bad day at Office today?” said Ravi by doing the same act again.\n\nShe reacted to it by walking briskly and then sat on top row of the entrance steps and said firmly, “I’m fine!” and then quickly changed her tone and said softly, “My dear sweet heart. Why don’t we sit here and chat for some time. It’s been so long that we met face to face.”\n\nRavi got puzzled for a second by her act and did as per her wish.\n\nThey just stared at the nature for few minutes till rain intervened their present status quo which forced them to pass the security and get inside the multiplex.\n\n“Which movie shall we go dear” asked Ravi while running over the pamphlet of ‘This Weeks Movie’.\n\nShe didn’t respond but just pretended to get lost in the surroundings.\n\n“Sweety, I think this movie list might not impress you. Can we go for a short 4DX movie. Are you in the game with me?”\n\nStill she pretended to get lost in the surroundings and started walking towards the food court.\n\nRavi followed from her behind. She simply ordered “1 Caffe Latte Large Please” and then sat on the sofa.\n\nRavi lost his all cool and sat fierce fully beside her and drew her face towards him with his both hands and shouted, “What-sup to you!!! Do you think I have travelled 700 odd miles from college to have this experience??? What do you want to convey to me?? Why don’t you speak up to me?”\n\n“Your Caffe Latte Large Ma’am” said the server by placing the coffee on the table with a smile and then he quickly passed to his counter.\n\nShe took the coffee mug slowly, enjoyed the aroma of the coffee and started to have the coffee sip-by-sip.\n\nRavi lost his temper again and said, “Miss Vidhya!!!, I’m leaving right now. This is high disrespect for a future Apple Employee”.  Saying this he put his iPhone in his left pocket and briskly walked away to the exit of the mall.\n\nShe responded to his behaviour by enjoying the coffee. By the time she finished having the final sip of coffee Ravi returned again silently and sat beside her.\n\n“Darling!!! What happened? Why are you doing like this? Did I do anything in aberration that has lost belief in me? (or) Are you getting MARRIED??? For god sake why don’t you speak up.” said Ravi in a normal voice.\n\n“My Dear Sweet Heart!!! You looked soo panic and worried and seems to be stressed out. Calm down. What did I do??” Replied Vidhya\n\n“What!!!!” replied Ravi with wide opened eyes and continued, “Of course your behaviour is creating a confusion for me which is leading to stress.”\n\n“Why are you getting stressed for my behaviour?”\n\n“I’m unable to understand how you are behaving. It is getting difficult to decipher what point you are trying to make.” said Ravi.\n\n“I didn’t get my answer Sweety. I think I asked you the wrong question. What makes you ‘more stressed’ now. Are you saying is it my behaviour or something else.” replied Vidhya calmly by seeing his eyes and continued, “I know you are intelligent enough to know how your subconscious thinking works.”\n\n“Are you saying that the reason for stress is my own thought process???” replied Ravi annoyingly.\n\n“Give a thought for some time my dear. Okie let me help you on this. What happens just before to you when you experience severe stress.” Vidhya replied to Ravi by getting up from the CCD Sofa.\n\nRavi did the same and they both started walking together.\n\n“Hmmm… A series of thoughts or assumptions or visualisations in my brain on future consequent actions based on your current state of behaviour.” responded Ravi as if he is recollecting the images of thoughts from his brain.\n\n“That’s why I love you darling. And you made your honest point. Let us take your point little forward. What makes your brain to quickly construct the future consequent actions.”\n\n“To be more honest with you as of now I thought that your marriage got fixed and you have accepted it.”\n\nVidhya laughed loudly and now she drew him closer to her body by keeping her right hand on his shoulder.\n\n“Sorry for the act played. But I will explain you the reason soon once we complete this discussion.” said Vidhya.\n\nVidhya continued,”Why did you think that my marriage got fixed?”\n\nAs the rain got stopped both them passed the other side of the gate and started walking towards N.T.R. Gardens.\n\nRavi regained his lost coolness and replied, “You have been saying from last four months that there is a pressure from your home on your marriage.”\n\n“Yes of course. It is still there. Okie, on a negative side what will happen if I get married to some one else?”\n\n“Vidhya, I request you not to say this at least in your dreams. I cannot loose you and I cannot think my life without you.” said Ravi.\n\n“So…” responded Vidhya immediately.\n\n“I cannot loose. That’s it. PERIOD.” replied Ravi strongly.\n\n“Can I conclude that the reason for your act is ‘fear of loosing me from your life’”, responded Vidhya.\n\n”I think so”.\n\n“If so, after your campus placement in the month of May. Why you couldn’t convey about our love to your parents. Where you have promised me exactly an year back here at the same place. Are you able to recollect it darling”. responded Vidhya.\n\nWith a blank and thoughtful mind Ravi along with Vidhya sat on a bench in N.T.R. Gardens.\n\nIt is 5:10 P.M. of 31st Oct 2017\n\n“To boost your confidence Ravi. I have told you many times that it will take me 4 more years to reach your offered CTC. Haven’t I? Also, I have never forced for a marriage, but due to our age difference I have been pushing you on that, such that our elders will converse soon. Didn’t I.”\n\nRavi gave a deep thought and sigh, “Now, I understand the reason for my 700 KM Travel. I definitely owe an explanation to you.”\nHe took a deep breath and continued,\n“I’m afraid of my father. On top of that our age gap keep my mouth shut whenever I tried to initiate the conversation on the similar lines.”\n\n“Who doesn’t have fear of explaining his love to their parents it is an universal fear for all the lovers. However, most the best love marriages occur when lovers manage the both fears successfully and convince their elders. Am I Right.” responded Vidhya.\nAnd again continued,\n“As per my understanding you have two fears which is splitting you apart which is causing you severe  stress.\n\n\n\nFear of loosing me\nFear of loosing parents { Like loosing their respect or something else }\n\nwhich of course happens for most of the lovers.”\n\nVidhya then turned her head to his side and took her both hands and tilted his head to her side as well and kissed him. And then she continued,\n“Now, I have a strong belief in my future Apple Company Employee that you can manage your both fears and make the best act that benefits all of us.” she smiled and got up and departed with a hug.\n\nRavi sat on the same bench and started to think seriously about his next actions & steps.\n\n—————————————————————————————————————————————————————\nFoot Note:\n\nF.E.A.R. { Not about Conditional Fear }\nAn underrated feeling which is the root cause of our survival as well as failures and etc.;\nA Balance of Managing the FEAR is utmost necessary to avoid stress and its related activities.\n1) If we couldn’t be afraid, we wouldn’t survive for long. We’d be walking into oncoming traffic, stepping off of rooftops and carelessly handling poisonous snakes.\n2) If we are too much afraid we get severe stress and frustrated and consequent actions occur. \nA Gallup Poll conducted in 2005 reveals the most common fears of teenagers in the United States. The top 10 list goes like this:\na) Terrorist attacks\nb) Spiders\nc) Death\nd) Failure\ne) War\nf) Heights\ng) Crime/Violence\nh) Being alone\ni) The future\nj) Nuclear war\nUnderstandingOurFear & Learning about it helps us to keep a check on our health…"

Emotional Hangover as I look at it; starts with normal symptoms such as lack of focus, anxiety, tension in the body, lack of motivation towards our health and few others. If we do not recognize these emotions they may aggravate and will effect our own life. \nTo note, any bad incident that happens in our life can never be erased. It can only be forgotten.\nLet us read this small story snippet to learn how Emotional Hangover kills us.\nStory Snippet: { Story in First Person }\nHi Friends, my name is Rahul Sharma. Most of my friends and especially my close friends and well wishers used to say that “You are good at almost every thing, however if you can control your emotions; you reach to new heights”. I used to think that “Lack of controlling our emotions is a cult and ignored it”.\nI realised that our true emotions comes out when our personal spaces overlap. Of course, when we are in relationship it is certain. Her name is Supriya, in initial days she enjoyed my love to full extent. Being more emotional ( as a lover we may not be able to control our emotions ) made her more gifted, excited and thrilled. Later after few months, my emotions led to break up. This made my emotional hangover further carried over to “alcohol over”.\nLater, after an year I have joined in my first company. In enthuse and being carried with the same emotional hang mentality, I was liked by all managers. The reason is being my stupendous productivity and involvement. However, later these own emotions again made myself complicated; leading my colleagues deserting my companionship; which finally lead to my resignation. This further made me loose my confidence, productivity, health, my goal and few others.\nLater, after couple of years when my emotions regained to its normal state; and after thorough analysis within myself I felt that in both the episodes; i.e.; in my love as well as in my career my view is 100% right. It went wrong only in my expression. My analysis and thinking is perfect but when I’m expressing my views, my emotions over ruled unconsciously. That showcases a different picture leading for unnecessary conclusions on my personality. Certainly, when we are in high emotional state our unconscious brain hinds our conscious process of thinking making us difficult to express to what we want to express.\nAlso, being more emotional becomes a tool for others to fulfil their interests and goals.\nI would like to stop the story at this juncture and leave the ending and conclusion to  your imagination.\n\nTo Conclude, Self Disciple and Self Control towards our own emotions certainly will lead to a happy and prosperous life.\n\nTo Note, even a small tweaking in our daily habits like daily jog/morning prayer will certainly lead to larger benefits of controlling our emotional hangover. “ What do you think the reason for it? is it a Domino effect?”"

    "text": "If you have heard about 99Club. This article is about possibility of shifting from 99Club to 100Club.\n“Dad!!! Good Morning. Yesterday I came across the term - ‘99Club’. I feel there is something awry about the concept. Have you felt it so?”\nHis dad got confused and asked - ” I always felt awry from the time when you started thinking and questioning me. This awry ofcourse should be new for me. Please continue son.”\nVikram smiled for his Dads Sarcasm and continued, “Let me cut down the crap and get straight to the point”.\n“Of course you should. Your dad is not yet retired.”\n“Dad!!!!”, said Vikram, by nodded his head side ways with a smile; and continued, ” The concept of 99Club seems to be about being happy with what we have. If we are happy with what we have then we become complacent and tend to be comfort zone. Right.  And this may lead to zero goal life.?”\n“Hope you are not saying me to that - ‘Dad; don’t get retire and become complacent.’. such that your eternal pocket money flow will be assumed forever.”\n“Dad!!! Please.”\n“Vikram, I’m trying to protect myself for any kind of shock that you might give it to me. However, your body language and expression communicating to me that you are indeed looking for some parental guidance after a long time. Great.”, saying this he set aside the file plank and got up from his chair and sat beside his son and continued, “Vikram, we had the same discussion long time ago. Happiness and goal are not related.”\n\n“I understand that dad. Like for example, Apple would not have become a large company if they become complacent. But 99Club concept says that - be happy with what you have”\n\n“Very Good. Did it became large company in a year?”\n\n“No. It took them long. Which is what I’m trying to say”\n\n“How many goals did Apple achieved”\n\n“If you mean in terms of products. It is iTune, Mac, iPhone, iPod etc.; so far as i can recollect”\n\n“Lovely. If we get back to the story of 99Club. Do u think iTune, Mac, iPod are individual coins which Apple is trying to collect to make it to 100?”\n\n“Nope Dad. Each is an individual project with different timelines. Success of each project pushed them to go for an extra mile each time”\n\n“How did they enjoy their each of their success”\n\n“They celebrated and shared their happiness with shareholders and stakeholders”\n\n“Great Vikram; You have contradicted your own assumption earlier. Isn’t it so. As you said, Apple is indeed was happy for their success and what they possess. However, they never got deviated from their larger goal of improving the customer experience through best use of technology.” He said and took and sip of water and then continued, ” The premise of 99Club is more about the humans relentless desire of non-completeness.”\n\nVikram, absorbed what is being told and thought for a while and said, “What Makes it Complete?”\n\n“That is a great question. We cannot bring in the Company discussion in this question as company by itself cannot make it complete. As it runs on Goals, Vision, Mission and finally by numbers. On the other side, humans are run by emotions most of the times.”\n\n“Of Course. Humans are emotional beings”\n\n“What do you think makes my day Vikram.”\n\nWithout any delay Vikram replied, ” As I know you, You feel happy whenever you spent some quality time with mom or me.”\n\n“Why do you think it makes me complete?”\n\n“Is it because you like them most?” Vikram questioned his father and nodded his head with a smile.\n\n“It is usually the other way round. It is because you both like being around with me.” said his father, ” In generally, if we share our positive emotions or moments with loved ones. It makes our day and make it complete. :) “\n\n”This is lovely. But however, I’m unable to relate this to control of relentless desires of human.”\n\n“Vikram. Human runs each and every day such that he and his future family is in a better off position.”\n\n“Agree”\n\n“However, there are some immediate dependants and some other indirect dependants; And all these dependants love to spend time with us. All we have to acknowledge them and give them some time, love and positive moments and emotions.”\n“Most of the times, all these interactions and moments make us realise that our dependants are happy with the existing status quo as well. Which shifts our gear from getting bigger in terms of desire to reaching to our goal.”\n\n“This is lovely to hear Dad. Love and belongingness plays a major role in our life”\n\n“Yes. it is more lovely because it gets strengthened when we reciprocate in a right way.”\n\nVikram got up and smiled and said to his father, “Dad!!! I got the message. I think i need to find girlfriend to make me complete.”\n\n“Good for you. All the best.”\nI would like to conclude this blog by saying HAVE A SWEET TIME WITH OUR SWEET HEARTS TO MAKE OUR LIFE SWEEEET  :)\nOne of my Fav. scene from Teen Maar Telugu movie { A Remake of Hindhi Movie - Love Aaj Kal }"

    "text": "Let us time travel in our thought process to one the first known ancient civilizations i.e.; Çatalhöyük. { I’m excluding the Harappan Civilisation which in recent times made the news to be the longest and ancient civilizations of all time (almost near to “Göbekli_Tepe”. As still sufficient information is yet to be available for more study. }\nÇatalhöyük is believed to be the first town in the history and as well believed to be the first known egalitarian society. It existed approximately at about  7,500 BCE. It seems that upto10,000 people used to lived in Catalhoyuk, which was about 1% of the global population at that time. It survived for 2,000 years which is of-course huge time.\n\nÇatalhöyük is believed to be the first town in the history and as well believed to be the first known egalitarian society. It existed approximately at about  7,500 BCE. It seems that upto10,000 people used to lived in Catalhoyuk, which was about 1% of the global population at that time. It survived for 2,000 years which is of-course huge time.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is more interesting to me is that \n\nAgriculture: “they also grew peas, almonds and pistachios, reared sheep and cattle, and gathered fruits from the forests. Hunting is as well the main source for food”. ”\nInfrastructure: The tightly packed “city”was made of simple mud-brick rooms that seemed to have been added on again and again as the community grew and changed across the centuries of habitation”.\nReligion: “The stately goddess seated on a throne flanked by two lionesses  was found in a grain bin, which suggests might have been a means of ensuring the harvest or protecting the food supply.In later cultures, similar depictions are seen of Cybele, a mountain goddess.”\nMining: “here is also evidence that the settlement was the first place in the world to mine and smelt metal in the form of lead”.\n\nEverything is almost there that is needed for a life to live in peace, harmony & prosperity.\nBeing an egalitarian society & no hierarchy in the society ; Çatalhöyük can as well be the first  Anarcho-communism state. Irony, is that people at that time aren’t aware of this term. They seems to live an uncomplicated life of having & cultivating good food; living in neat society and places; living together as a team.\nNow-a-days, we are having tough time to get along with teams even for one full day due to our over dependence on non-living things. Then how come a civilisation stayed as a team for approx. 7,30,000 days. Harmony would have lost among the society if few of them questioned to themselves W.I.F.M. Not our mistake but now our society has become fragmented and highly hierarchal (especially in last 200 years) which makes us to question ourselves W.I.F.M. \nHowever, during this span of 9000 years what seems to we have lost is that understanding and living a life - don’t think about result this creates tension in your mind give your full effort sincerely this gives the result which you deserve. This is difficult to practice But this is best practice in life.once you know the greatness of this quality, practice it everything comes for you. \nIt looks like the Çatalhöyük Soceity has followed the same for 7,30,000 days as also has strong faith on Kartha, Karma & Kriya Process which allowed them to work as a team.\n\nKARTA = Performer. \nKRIYA = Method/Implementation. \nKARMA = Consequences.\n\nW.I.F.M may be good for short term survival. However, if those ancestors and our ancestors would have thought on those same lines we would not be such a privileged society with all the basic comforts.\nTo conclude, KRIYA is the only thing that is in our hands that helps to work in positive direction to do value addition for the betterment for the future and existing society."

    "text": "I found myself on my reading desk with my left cheek on it. Slowly I made my spine straight and started massaging my forehead with my index finger such that my right eyebrow edge rests on my thumb. This is my usual style while I’m in deep thinking.\nNow it is 6:20 A.M.\nI smiled and said to myself “Three nights on a row on reading table. Wow!!!”.\nAfter my quick refreshment, had couple of brown bread slices along with a glass of low fat cow milk (sugarless); and then I’m back to my usual routine of reading morning newspaper.\n\nAs i was about to start reading the newspaper. My eyes are closed with soft little fingers; I quickly realised it was of my beautiful kid.\n“Very Good Morning my dear”\n“Good Morning Papaaaa & Many Happy Returns of the day!!!” said my kid with so much excitement filled in eyes.\nLife teaches us a lot. Specially, when our kids enter into our life it marks a special & tectonic shift in our priorities upon them. Be it how much they grow, they remain as our kids forever. One of the shifts is that we tend to forget our own birthdays.\n\n“Thank you a lot, my love.”\n\n“Enjoy the day Papa. Will be back in couple of hours, got to attend a conference call.”\n\nAnd I’m back to my usual routine for the day.\n\nNow it is 7:20 A.M.\n\nMy wife isn’t in town due to unavoidable circumstances; this resulted in completing three non-fiction books in three straight days. Today for a change i’m inclined to watch a movie series on NetFlix. No Sooner I got engrossed in Elementary Series for about 4 hours.\n\nNow it is 12 NOON.\n\nI’m completely famished; with the available bechamel sauce in the refrigerator and fusilli in the container;  i started preparing my favourite pasta which i learned from my Italian friend Andrea.  Lunch is prepared in no time.\n\nI’m yet to start as I’m expecting my child to be in dining room by this time. But it didn’t happened. I’m perplexed as i never had such a lengthy conference call in my entire career,  and wondered how come this young kid got one. With this curious mindset i started climbing the stairs and knocked his home office room. { This generation kids has no difference between home and office }. My kid opened the door and sat on the table.\n\nAt first i thought meeting is going on; but it took me little time to recognise that my kid is just staring at the computer. My old age concluded that the kid looks baffled.\n\nWhat happened dear!!! You look so confused!! Can I be of your help?“\n\n”Thanks a lot Papa. for so long in my life i have been bothering you for small and little things. I felt that, if I could not handle this situation you may feel low on me about my capability.”\n\n“Remember Beta. Papa will never feel low about you. Papa only takes care about your long term happiness”, I kissed on forehead and continued, “If I can be of your help. Can you explain me your situation”.\n\n“Due to my poor communication and rapport with one of the most important client; my company was on the verge of loosing a quarter million dollar project. However, my boss saved me and the client has decided to go with our company with a string attached that I should not be the SPOC for the project. This morning my boss gave me a strong warning about my assertive behaviour and told to be humble toward my clients”\n\nKid paused for a while and continued, “For last few years I’m only successful with my assertive behaviour which helped the company to get many valuable projects. How come my boss conclude about me with one such incident!”\n\nI smiled and said in a slow yet in strong voice, “Are you worried about your bosses comment or about your clients remark to your boss?”\n\n“Both”\n\n“If I tell you to choose only one and work on it; such that the other one will evade; which one do you prefer to choose?”\n\n“Of-course, i will worry about my clients comment as it might impact my future career. But he is one of the many clients that I handled.”\n\n“You are on right track for half of it. But remember that he is the most important client”.\n\n“Agree Papa. Do you expect me to be more humble? I have to be assertive to convince the customer about the product. Both humble and assertive cannot go hand-in-hand as i look at it.”\n\n“Okie. Assume that you are right Beta. But on this special case it negates your fundamental thought process because of the incident that your experienced at your work place. Can you help me to download your definition of humble for me.”\n\n“As per my understanding. It is lowering ones own self esteem; which of-course i cannot do it.”\n\n“Are you sure about the definition.”\n\n“Yes Papa. This is what the google says”\n\n“Let us assume that you are right. What happens to you if you behave humble”.\n\n“Dad!!! I already told you”\n\n“Okie. Okie. I got it. Let me reframe such that i can get my answer. Does humble places you one step below your client and assertiveness on one step above?”\n\n“I never said it like that papa”\n\n“Don’t lie to me beta. Just now you have said that humble means lowering your self esteem. Assume that if it is true. What happens to you if you behave in such a way.”\n\n“Then….may be as i don’t like to behave in such a way and I might force that particular behaviour on me. Which may lead to self punishing and impacting my confidence and self respect.”\n\n“Great and Lovely answer my kid. To start with; let us take your last sentences that you mentioned - Humble is self punishing & leads to loose confidence and self respect”\n\nI paused for a second, to see how my kid is reacting on this. Kid seems to be curious about my further statements.\n\nSo I continued, “Is it not near to Self Humiliation. As i look at it my dear, English is a very beautiful language. Every feeling has a different word and different context.”\n\nAnd to further make my point i continued, “On the other side, you might be assuming that being assertive places a higher importance-weightage on your side. If you speak as if you are more important, people will assume that you are arrogant”\n\nKid interrupted suddenly and said, “I would agree to your point on self humiliation but certainly not on Assertiveness & Arrogance. As assertive is being confident and arrogance is assuming that i know better than the other.”\n\n“You are perfectly right my dear child. If you are assertive and not treating other person as equal as you. Then the other person assume that you are showing off your knowledge and superiority. And it is their right to assume.”\n\nAs my kid didn’t interrupted i continued again, “Usually the side effects of self humiliation and arrogance is the same; we try to become more resistance from inside to protect our identity. During the phase of self-humiliation we tend to become resistant to uplift our image. While for the other we tend to become resistant to prove our point strongly. On the contrary, Humble & Assertiveness doesn’t lead to a resistant behaviour.”\n\n“Dad. This is beautiful to listen. Is it practically possible to be the both.???”\n\nI smiled and said,“All I’m saying is to treat the other person as equal as you, which is a better meaning for humble, and speak confidently about the point you want to convince. As i look it, convincing is about listening, understanding and sharing about a particular thing on which you are confident and interested.”\n\n“Thanks a lot Dad. Few of them would have gone over my head. But I’m carrying a message that I have to humble & assertive towards my clients which solves both the party needs.”\n\n“Lovely my child. I’m famished. Lets finish our lunch and rush for any movie. Let us enjoy the life buddy”."

    "text": "By nature humans look to reduce the burden of their regular work. This is because we usually get bored by banal work. And this has propelled humans to think in a visionary way to place future generations in a comfort. On the other side, there are just around 1000 best inventions that has changed the world i.e.; from ‘Controlled Fire’ to latest 3D Printing.\nQuick Summary of Uber View of Inventions:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMileStone\nTime Period\nNo. of Inventions\n\n\nThe Ancient World\n1,420,000 B.C. to 100 B.C\n200\n\n\nFrom Rome to Revolution\n100 B.C. to 1800 A.D.\n120\n\n\nThe Industrial Age\n1800 A.D. to 1860 A.D\n120\n\n\nRifle Ages\n1860 A.D to 1890 A.D\n110\n\n\nModern Age\n1890 A.D to 1915 A.D\n120\n\n\nWar & Peace\n1915A.D to 1950 A.D\n120\n\n\nGoing Global\n1950 A.D. to 1969 A.D.\n110\n\n\nThe Internet Age\n1969 A.D to 2010 A.D\n100\n\n\n\n\n1000\n\n\n\nIndustrial Explosion has created a number of opportunities for inventions. Think about a person who was born in year 1950s and still alive; they might have experienced approximately 200 inventions during their life time. What they have seen is that world is expanding in quick time. In the above table if we had drawn another column say global population. The Invention Index Upon Population would be on a decreasing trend.\nIt is not that the people have become more lazy during the years. It is only that the inventions in the earlier ages were visible. So, identification of opportunity isn’t a difficult but the methodology of invention was very difficult.\nAs we progressed, the implementation of invention and reachability of invention to larger people has became prominent as the opportunity identification of invention has become difficult than the methodology itself. {Except a few}\nSo on a survival note, that old person of 1950s communicate to their children as how privileged the current generation and how they should be smart in using the inventions for their better comfort and living in the society.\nIn reality, all of a sudden what we experience is to have more time at our perusal than our earlier generations. To quote a small example: paying an electricity bill in 1990 used to took at-least 20 minutes and in 2018 it takes hardly a minute through Paytm. So, what this generation experiences is that they have more time at their perusal than the earlier generation.\nThe main challenge is that what do we do with balance 19 Min…. i.e.; our brain would be idle for 19 min and we all know from the famous adage i.e.; Idle man’s brain is devil’s workshop. And now,  no one has guided us on how to use this balance time; so we leave it on auto-mode. { In any generation, after our survival needs are met we had a leisure which was usually on an average used to spent with family, society, work, career etc.; { for some work is a survival need }. }\nIn auto-mode as we are not steering ourselves; we usually react to the situations because survival instincts come into play. Which makes us to think in a negative way.\nSay for example, we would like to kill the available time by taking to our love. However, love’s mobile was on waiting. The immediate activity for most of the youth is to call their love until they pick the call and later to only hear the word “Lets break up”. This usually happens because we get impatient and construct a negative imaginary world in quick time.\nOur survival instincts are so powerful that it can think in multiple dimensions in quick time; but it is difficult to harness and maintain that power for a regular living. Leading only to damage our own inner peace. Quick solution that most of us get us is to divert our thinking on something else like reading, watching tv etc.; Which is like taking a pill and sleeping than arresting the root cause. \nAs most of you might have read more ‘self help’ books than me; I would like to conclude the blog by saying that - If we want to steer our life into a happy zone we have to steer our thinking into a positive direction by taking the control of our thinking. The solution is not about managing the free time. It is about how are we living in free time in qualitative terms. Once we start living in those chunks of free time we start living in the moment and thus in our life. \n                                        Our Thinking - Our Life."

If I want to write what should I write?” This was first surfaced to my subconscious on 22nd March 2015, the day after I have received my second masters’ degree in “Business Analytics” at ISB Hyderabad.\nIn the course of time a lot of questions have exploded in my head. So, I felt that there is a need to understand the roots of my blogging habit (how it has started and matured over time).\nTo understand my habit, I have used the most fascinating and powerful book, “How Habits Work” by Charles Duhigg. In this book he mentions that habit works in a loop as Cue, Routine and Reward.\n\n\n\n\n\nI have started blogging from the year 2010 to improve my communication skills only. Certainly, I have used blogger as a platform to improve my written skills such that when people read my blogs they should not feel awkward about my way of expression. Also, I’m fortunate enough to receive best in class feedback from my friends, family and well-wishers. And if you are able to comprehend this particular piece of blog, of course it is their consistent feedback that helped me to improve.\nAfter a year, I have upgraded my usage of blogger platform for expressing my personal views on well-known topics/issues. This helped me to improve my essay structure. Eventually, after six months I have dried out of interesting topics. So, I consulted my friends and well-wishers on any topic that they would like to have a novel analysis. Thus the blog finally emerged as http://www.arunviews.com {which is currently not available}. In this blog, I have started to share my own views on various topics of audience interest. Certainly, this helped me to improve my reading and analytical skills as I have to comprehend on multifarious topics and provide short analysis.\nIn a while, my habit loop for blogging has become: Cue: Finalizing one of the topic for the blog provided by my friends. Routine: Read and Analyze on the specific topic & post the blog online. Reward: Expression of satisfaction of the topic especially by topic provider.\nIndeed, I was enjoying in this way for more than a year. Also, whenever I see a research on similar lines of my blog it always provided me a deep sense of satisfaction. However, as I have started to read and analyze on various topics; my particular interest on confluence of Psychology, Analytics and Management always leave me intrigued, amazed and thrilled. Consequently, I could not generate further cue for writing blogs as I hardly created a blog of my own topic.\nSo I would like to change my existing habit loop for blogging as below: Cue: Pick a topic of my interest in the confluence area of three topics. Routine: Read and Analyze on the specific topic & post the blog online. Reward: Expression of satisfaction of the topic by the blog reader and by myself.\nIt gives a sense of fulfilment in finding out the reasons of our old habits and to take the outcome in our stride. Therefore, I would like to write blogs of my own interest which leaves me extremely happy and satisfied when I finally post it online."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Poverty: the state of being inferior in quality or insufficient in amount. Hunger: a situation in which the body does not have enough food. Above definitions becomes subjective without any substantial numerical adjective to it. So, the world bank updates the poverty line, as per changing cost of living, to identify the families whose economic position falls below the min. threshold/acceptance value. As of October 2015, the new global line updated to $1.90 per day i.e.; approx. 120 INR per day.\nIdeally the arriving at this number is extremely important as it helps the government to torchlight the projects & policies on alleviating the poverty through subsidies, health programs and etc.; which as well helps them to take necessary decisions on the viability of the programs.\nAs per these definitions, on an average 1 person out of 10 are in poverty globally; India has the same figures as well. { 2 in year 2011 }\nIt is in generally assumed that a person will be remained in poverty trap forever if his future earnings are less than that of present earnings. However, the inability of the poor to feed themselves properly is also one of the most frequently cited root causes of a poverty trap. The intuition is powerful: the poor cannot afford to eat enough; this makes them less productive and keeps them poor.\n\nIn last two decades thanks to the Indian Government for its policies and subsidies and thanks for our hard working people. 4/10 in year 2000 has reduced to 2/10 in 2011 and is expected to be 1/10 by this time.\n\nIf the above intuition is right the reverse is as well should be right. i.e.; when more people are becoming less poor there should be lesser and lesser hunger people. Also, the people who are in actual hunger has to be less than that of poor people.\n\nOn the contray, the figures showcases something different. 1 in 7 are in hunger. Figures would be worst, if we include the people who are in hidden hunger.\nSo, the above definitions on poverty suggests us that it is a one dimensional measure i.e.; income. This it all boils down to the fundamental principle of analytics i.e.; correlation and causality. Lower Income Correlates to Poverty. But does that explain the reasons for poverty. Because, the right measure and insight helps the government to deploy its resources and design the policies and create subsidies such that the required resources reaches to the needy in time. \n\nAs of now, Let us assume that the world banks benchmark on poverty is right. If the people has enough money to meet their basic needs then where does the money spent by poor goes ???\n\nDoes the poor are inclined to buy more tastier than nutritious.?\nDoes the subsidised food becomes over subsidised such that it makes the consumer surplus become negligible.?\nAre they love to spend on status acquiring things like tv, mobiles and etc.; than taking care of their health?\n\nTo conclude:\nThe world produces enough food to feed everyone. Achieving food and nutrition security is still a great challenge for the poorest around the world. The world continues to consume more food every year as the population grows, and due to rising demand for industrial uses of food."

    "section": "",
    "text": "What is SUCCESS:\nBelow reference has been taken from “business dictionary”\nAchievement of an action within a specified period of time or within a specified parameter. Success can also mean completing an objective or reaching a goal. Success can be expanded to encompass an entire project or be restricted to a single component of a project or task. It can be achieved within the workplace, or in an individual’s personal life. For example, if an individual’s personal goal is to be accepted in a new career, success would occur after the individual has been officially accepted into his or her new place of employment.\n\nExample:\nNow let us assume that a person(say a student) success is to get accepted in a good college. Mathematically, the outcome of a success is a boolean outcome that is Yes/No. { i.e.; Either he gets accepted or not }.\n\nUsually, that particular student works hard for the required entrance examination. And he practices many mock tests to minimise the errors in the actual test. Unknowingly, the student has modelled success in his mind as a function of hard work & function of practice.\n\nF(Success) = F(Hard-work) + F(Practice).\n\nGood for the student. He cracked the exam and got into the college that he aimed for. Thus he achieved success.\n\nThe by-product of this success is that the student assumes that his “so called success model” is correct; that is success is a function of Hard-work & Practice.\n\nDuring his graduation process for each semester he uses his best worked success model { as it is already proven according to him } to get better grades. Good for him!!! He got his assumed success in each and every semester.\n\nAnd you have to agree that each time his success model got reinforced in his brain as it is the best success model and can usher him to achieve the endless success in life.\n\nYet again he aimed for the one of the big-4 companies and got succeeded.\n\nAgain and Again his SUCCESS Model got reinforced in his mind.\n\nAs it is a story now let us assume that after one year of his work life he faced his first failure i.e.; he couldn’t get the assumed hike.\n\nAs his conscious thought process already got over-written by his reinforced thinking of his success model. It would be ideally be tough for the person to accept the failure in his model and starts reacting on the failure.\n\nHe further works hard and practices hard and yet in the consecutive year he faces another failure. Then for the first time he starts questioning about his “so called success model”. Then he realises that that the actual model for the success is:\n\nF(Success) = F(Hard-work) + F(Practice) + Residual(or)Random\n\nUpon deeper introspection into his life he realises that the another most important factor that has contributed to his success is his peers. So, he adjusts the success model again as\n\nF(Success) = F(Hard-work) + F(Practice) + F(Peers/Friends) + Residual(or)Random\nHowever, he kept the Residual/Random to be part of the model for his future learning. Because he has believed and reinforced the old adage “FAILURES ARE THE STEPPING STONES FOR THE SUCCESS”.\nTo conclude, we can enjoy the fruits of success; however we should be humble enough to give due credit for the surrounding environment/circumstances that helped us to achieve the success. \nNote: Usually the higher the success a person aims for the larger the model it is and attribution of randomness to success cannot be negated.\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nWhen coming to business we cannot have multiple failures and unexplained Randomness for the business success. As the business has to stand longer than human life.\nSo, on the same lines the Key Performance Indicators are brought into business dictionary to reduce the randomness of the business success and have better controls."

    "text": "In this blog post i would like to discuss a special case of game theory {Non-Cooperative game} within ourselves. Let me run thru basic introduction on game theory. { for new learners }\nGame Theory: { https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory} { Bargaining Problem - By Sir John Nash }\nThose who love Intense Mathematics & Differential Equations can run through the above links. In this blog post, let me explain the beautiful theory with a famous example that is discussed in most of the Text Books.\n\nSituation: There are two thieves { say Mahesh & Ram } have committed a diamond burglary.  Sleuths have gathered basic evidence, but still they need more evidence to imprison them. So, they decided to apply the Non-Cooperative game theory.\n\nThey approached the thieves separately and discussed three scenarios: { And asked them to pick one of these three }\n\nScenario-1: If you did confess and other didn’t: You will get zero years. Other will get 10 years of sentence.\nScenario-2: If both you confess. You both will get 5 years of sentence.\nScenario-3: If both you didn’t confess. Both of you will get 2 years of sentence.\n\n\n\n\n Mahesh/Ram\nDon’t Confess\nConfess\n\n\nDon’t Confess\n2,2\n10,0\n\n\nConfess\n0,10\n5,5\n\n\n\nIn an ideal situation, if both of them are to be safe they should not confess. \nHowever, as they aren’t not loyal to each other. Probability to confess for evading the sentence is high; which is usually called as Prisoners dilemma. And in most cases, it happens to be that they both confesses the crimes.\nDefinition: Game theory is the analysis of a situation involving conflicting interests in terms of gains and losses among opposing players\nThis is a very simple example; the mathematical model and its application for “n” number of players has made by Sir John Nash for which he has awarded with Nobel Prize.\nBlog:\nLet us assume that there are two people { That is Present-You & Future-You }. Let us take a simple decision/situation that we take in our life “We want to maintain our weight & health by consistent work-out”\nThe ideal situation is where-in we can become better-off is by taking time for our daily work-out. Let us see how decision happens for most of us. { It is just a simple example for portraying the outcome for this blog }\nPresent-You has to take two decisions i.e.; to perform work-out or not and similarly Future-You has to accommodate the work-out or no work-out for the future.\nPresent-You thinks that if i take a decision to work-out it would be good. If Present-You didn’t perform work-out; it will all its time and energy to glorify the better present for the future. Such that Future-You has all its time to perform work out.\nSimilarly, Future-You thinks that i would not be able to perform workout as I have to manage my time and energy for future. So, Future-You wants Present-You to perform work out such that upgraded future demands more time and energy than present.\nThis results in a no work-out situation for both Present-You and Future-You. \nI tried to portray through this classic example where we create our daily dilemma that works against us which hinders our health and wellness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPresent You\nPresent You\n\n\n\n\nWork Out\nNo Work Out\n\n\nFuture You\nWork Out\nBest & Ideal Situation\nI can manage present work & Time\n\n\nFuture You\nNo Work-Out\nI can manage future work & Time\nI can manage both work & time at all times\n\n\n\nTo conclude:\nThere are similar situations that arise in our life; where-in we remain in status-quo for long duration of time.\nIt is not that we are afraid to take risks and go ahead. It is just that our own forces work against us albeit we know that the results are always fruitful.\nNote: As Sadguru says - ” The Individual who has to take care of his their own health & wellness is only YOU”.\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nMy favourite scenes from ” A Beautiful Mind” Movie:\nGame theory Explanation"

    "text": "It’s been long time I have penned my opine. This time, I chose a topic that’s been greatly researched; and been perceived as a “state”.\nIn this article i tried to showcase about my understanding on Happiness (but certainly not talking about Happiness Index- which is damn debatable).\nIt was 3rd Feb of Year 2014 @ 10:30 A.M. I was at Vemulavada (Sri Raja Rajeshwara Temple) along with my larger family. As we are walking on our way to our lodges (after our Dharshan), few of them de-routed to another lane to buy some gifts and other apparels, abandoning my father and me.\n“Dad, what’s in the breakfast”, I asked my father as if it is the next thing on my activity list.\n“Arun, let them come. How are you feeling about your recent endeavour of getting admission to ISB.”\n“I’m feeling happy, Dad”.\n“Are you trying to say that getting admitted into ISB is making you happy. Are you trying to correlate the happiness with respect to external environment?” \n“I could not get you”\nHe said so many philosophical things at that time. But none couldn’t get into my brain. I felt he sensed the same and finally he took his index finger and placed on centre of my forehead and said “Happiness lies here”. I couldn’t get the sense to what my father was saying as I felt that I’m intelligent enough to understand about Happiness from “Google” in a simpler way.  After an year I only realised that “Happiness” is still a fuzzy concept in Philosophy and Psychology. \nLately on 1st of Week of Feb 2018; out of blue, when I was browsing youtube, I found this lovely collated video of Sadguru by Dorothy.\n\nVide Summaries about “5 Things that Happy People do differently”.\n\nLive in Present\nDon’t take yourself too seriously\nTake responsibility for your inner state\nManage yourself not others\nRealise that your not immortal\n\nOnly after 4 years I realised what is meant by “Happiness lies here”. i.e.; Happiness lies within you. \nI will try to explain in simpler way;\nGod has given us many vital organs namely such as brain, eyes, mouth, teeth and several others. If we  take care of them wisely and make use of them optimally/fullest we will be in a state of happiness.\nFor example, most happy people are found to be best programmers, best artists and best authors who use their most wisest organs to be fullest. They use it to the fullest because they are not best but because they have a sense of satisfaction once they use their organs to the fullest, which makes them to be happy.\n\nUsing our Organs at optimal/fullest - Makes us feel Satisfied.\nRealisation of Satisfaction - Makes us feel happy.\nContinuous loop of Point 1 & 2 - A Celebration.\n\nWe don’t need an occasion for a Celebration. All we need ourselves to Celebrate each and every moment of our life.\nA positive mind reflects positivity; A Smile Engenders Smiles; A celebrating soul lives a life;"
