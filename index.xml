  <title>CRIMES AGAINST WOMEN</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>These days, every brat on <code>YouTube</code> speaks about their fundamental right to <code>freedom of expression</code>. However, I would love to keep <code>Human Rights</code> on a higher plane compared to <code>Fundamental Rights</code> as <code>Violence against Women and Girls</code> is one of the world’s most prevalent human rights violations and a global pandemic. Violence in any form creates physical, economic and psychological consequences not only for women but also for the entire society. For this reason, <code>Ved Vyas</code> himself penned <code>Devi Bhagavata Purana</code> to uphold the dignity of women in our society.</p>
<p>In the first place, let us explore the types of violence against women. As per my comprehension, I have categorized them into six categories: Domestic Violence, Sexual Harassment, Harassment, POCSO, Sexual Violence and Cyber Crime. The below graph depicts the trend of violence against women between 2019 and 2021 in India.</p>

<section id="types-of-violence-against-women" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="types-of-violence-against-women">Types of Violence against women</h2>
<section id="domestic-violence" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="domestic-violence">Domestic Violence</h3>
<p>According to United Nations, domestic Violence includes acts of <code>physical violence</code> such as slapping, chocking or burning, <code>sexual violence</code> including spousal rape, <code>psychological violence</code> such as fear by intimidation or forced isolation, and <code>economic violence</code> by maintaining total control over financial resources, withholding access to money or forbidding attendance to employment. In the Indian Context, there are four major crime headings under which we can register a case:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cruelty by husband or relatives</li>
<li>Dowry Death</li>
<li>Abetment of Suicide of Women</li>
<li>PWDVA - Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act</li>
</ul>
<p>The total number of cases registered under domestic Violence in 2021 is 1,62,354, which translates to <code>11</code> domestic cases in one year for every 1 Lac (1,00,000) population (25,000 households). We can only infer on this metric if we have a comparison. Let’s do some fact check: the number of domestic cases registered for every 1 Lac (1,00,000) population in the USA and Norway is <code>300</code> and <code>106</code> respectively. Wow!!! India scored a bingo on this metric, and yet we have less <code>women</code> representation in the workforce. Where is the leak?</p>
<p>The leak is in reporting. People who understand the geo-socio-economical dynamics would love to argue that this is a gross under-reported number. Reporting of such crimes depends upon the community, and for various reasons, including lack of social support, shame, and stigma, women selectively report cases. Although systematic gaps exist in registering the cases, most of us are merely mute spectators. Adding to this, domestic Violence is one of the most common forms of Violence experienced by women globally. As per the NFHS report, on average, Indian women are 17 times more likely to face sexual Violence from their husbands than others and we see almost negligble cases under this crime. So, under this context, have we normalized domestic Violence as a society?</p>
</section>
<section id="sexual-harassment-and-harassment" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sexual-harassment-and-harassment">Sexual Harassment and Harassment</h3>
<p>Sexual Harassment and Harassment include verbal, non-verbal, or physical conduct, as well as written and electronic communications. It includes acts of verbal threat, acid attack, kidnap/abduction, abuse, unwanted touching, rubbing/brushing, repeatedly asking for dates/sex, comments on appearance, bodyparts, clothing and others. Coming to the Indian Context, the following are the major crime headings we can register a case:</p>
<ul>
<li>Acid attack</li>
<li>Attempt to acid attack</li>
<li>Kidnapping and abduction of women</li>
<li>Insult to the modesty of women</li>
<li>Assault on women with intent to outrage her modesty</li>
<li>Indecent representation of women</li>
</ul>
<p>The total number of cases registered under this category in 2021 is 1,73,015, which translates to <code>12</code> cases in one year for every 1 Lac (1,00,000) population (25,000 households). The USA and Norway have similar numbers of around <code>11</code> cases per year for every 1 Lac population. It is obvious from the crime descriptions that these cases are copious enough to be registered, and they do not come up with any stigma attached, so the cases registered are on par with those of developed economies.</p>
</section>
<section id="pocso" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="pocso">POCSO</h3>
<p>POCSO is referred to as <code>Protection of children from sexual offences</code>. Often, these include acts of sexual assault, harassment, child pornography and others. So, to make this more holistic category, I have added selling and buying minor girls under this heading:</p>
<ul>
<li>Selling of minor girls</li>
<li>Buying of minor girls</li>
<li>POCSO Act</li>
</ul>
<p>The total number of cases registered under this crime heading is 52,850 in 2021, which translates to approximately <code>4</code> cases per year for every 1 Lac. If we include child abuse cases, the majority would be of child marriage and forced labour. The numbers would shoot up to <code>129</code> cases per year for every 1 Lac. Of course, it is a bothersome problem in India, with millions of children being subjected to physical, emotional, and sexual abuse every year. The USA has similar numbers of around <code>130</code> cases per year for every 1 Lac.</p>
<p>Although the cases registered are on par with developed economies, are they still underreported?</p>
</section>
<section id="sexual-violence" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sexual-violence">Sexual Violence</h3>
<p>Sexual Violence is any harmful or unwanted sexual behaviour that is imposed on women. It includes abusive sexual contact, forced engagement in sexual acts, attempted or completed sexual acts with a woman without her consent, unwanted touching, incest, and others. In India, we can register cases of Sexual Violence under the following five headings as per my comprehension.</p>
<ul>
<li>Human Trafficking</li>
<li>Rape</li>
<li>Attempt to commit rape</li>
<li>Immoral traffic prevention act</li>
<li>Murder with rape or gang rape</li>
</ul>
<p>The total cases registered under this crime heading is 37,462 in 2021, which translates to approximately <code>3</code> cases per year for every 1 Lac While in the USA, it is approximately <code>20</code> cases per year for every 1 Lac. Based on these statistics, are developed countries more dangerous for women to stay and live in compared to India?</p>
<p>As per the NFHS ( National Family Health Survey ) conducted in the year 2015-16, approximately <code>86%</code> of the Sexual Violence Crimes in India don’t get reported. This learning would equate to that of the USA, which has 21 cases per year for every 1 Lac of population. So, is there any social stigma attached to a rape victim?</p>
</section>
<section id="cyber-crime" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="cyber-crime">Cyber Crime</h3>
<p>Cybercrime affects women the most. It subjects them to mental and emotional harassment. The most common cyber crimes against women include blackmail, threats, cyberpornography, and publishing of obscene sexual content. It also includes stalking, bullying, defamation, morphing, and the establishment of fake profiles.</p>
<p>Although we see numerous fake profiles and online abuse of women, only 2,597 cases were registered in 2021. In the USA, the number of reported cases is approximately 10,000. This type of crime looks to be malignant. So, women block the online perpetrator’s profile or go offline from social media for a few days instead of reporting. Under this context, are women fostering any societal habit?</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="conclusion" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Earlier, I planned to provide my opinion on the questions in the previous sections. However, questions are sufficient for the reader to introspect and comprehend. Of course, every reader can understand in many ways, but if we realize that everything starts at home, then I’m happy.</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to present the correlation plot among these categories. The notable fact in this correlation plot is that <code>Domestic Violence</code> is highly correlated with <code>Harassment</code> and <code>Sexual Violence</code>. Does it communicate how we treat women at home, and does the same behaviour percolate in society?</p>

<p>Finally I would like to end the essay with a famour quote from Swami Vivekananda - “All Nations have attained greatness by praying proper respect to women. That Country and nation which do not respect women has never become great, nor will ever be in future”.</p>

  <title>Cognitive Delusion under Information Deluge?</title>

<p><span style="font-size: small;">Note: this blog is not about mental disorders.</span></p>
<section id="delusion-vs-hallucation" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="delusion-vs-hallucation">Delusion vs Hallucation?</h2>
<p>Everyone would doubt the difference between delusion and Hallucination. I hope this section will bring the initial conceptual clarity.</p>
<p>Delusion, in simple words, is having firm beliefs despite contrary evidence. Hallucination is something living in that belief or world, although it doesn’t exist.</p>
<p>In the psychiatric world and for mental disorder patients, they often overlap.</p>
<p>But as of now, let us step in and see these two through two different lenses.</p>
<p><em>Example1</em>: Assume that <code>Subhash</code> loved playing cricket since his childhood. He has been to the best coaching centers in the city to get trained. But for practice, he used to play with his school friends instead of cricket ground friends. This made him believe that he was the best in his game. During <code>under 14</code> selections, he didn’t fare well compared to his peers as per the selection committee. However, <code>Subhash</code> labeled this selection as grossly politically favored to certain sections of kids as he could not believe that his skill wasn’t up to the mark. So, he still believes that he is best at his game, although there is clear evidence that he isn’t. In this scenario <code>Subhash</code> is in a delusion that he has all the necessary skills to be part of the district team.</p>
<p><em>Example2</em>: Let’s exaggerate the behaviour of <code>Subhash</code> for this example. <code>Subhash</code> has been continuously rejected for four consecutive years and got good feedback from coaches to improve his technique and skill. Despite this, he still believes that he is good at his game. Later, to overcome these several setbacks, he abandoned attending cricket coaching classes and instead formed a small team with his school friends and lived in that world. He was so invincible with his school friends that he derived a theory and started communicating that the selection committee and coaches were corrupted, and they stopped his growth intentionally and hid his talent to resurface to the world. At this stage, he is hallucinating unknown events, which can be termed a hallucination.</p>

<section id="what-is-delusion-in-information-era" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-is-delusion-in-information-era">What is delusion in information era?</h2>
<p>In the information era, we have deluge access to information, which I would like to categorize into four ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Info A</strong>: Information that we like and is relevant.</li>
<li><strong>Info B</strong>: Information that we don’t like and is relevant.</li>
<li><strong>Info C</strong>: Information that we like and isn’t relevant.</li>
<li><strong>Info D</strong>: Information that we don’t care.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is no empirical information about the distribution of this information. But as per my personal experience, I can say that the majority of the information sits in <code>Info D</code>. But we all care about <code>Info A</code> and <code>Info C</code>.</p>
<p>Since we delve into the information that we only care about, there is a 100% chance that we form many <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/bias">biases</a>. These <code>biases</code> will create our self-full prophecy belief system and might push us into delusion.</p>

<section id="why-do-we-have-delusion-and-its-probable-reasons" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-do-we-have-delusion-and-its-probable-reasons">Why do we have delusion and its probable reasons?</h2>
<p>The primary outcome of a delusion is a conclusion without caring for any further evidence to confirm or solidify that evidence. Rather than going through the variety of information in this era, we might get into the deluge of the information we believe. Also, Google answers what we ask and doesn’t offer what we need for our holistic thought process.</p>
<p>There are multiple reasons to have our delusions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Genetic factors</li>
<li>Biological factors</li>
<li>Psychological factors</li>
<li>Environmental factors</li>
</ul>
<p>In pre-Google era, information deluge isn’t available. Now, in the information era, this particular environment would contribute to the creation of delusions.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="closing-remarks">Closing remarks</h2>
<p>There aren’t any suggestions from my side, as this is still a learning process. Furthermore, I have genuinely believed in technology and its progress. So, the onus lies on the user to use it rather than to become dependent on the devices. Also, it is wise to turn to humans occasionally instead of a device, as humans design devices.</p>

  <title>Extended Learnings -124 | Indian Culture | Perennial Cycle of Ānanda ( Bliss )</title>
  <dc:creator>Arun Koundinya Parasa</dc:creator>
  <link>https://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning124/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>This blog piece comes almost after a year but at the right time, albeit there is a long hiatus. Lately, I have started a Spiritual YouTube Channel (in line with this blog series), wherein I’m sharing personal-level comprehension instead of metaphysical levels.</p>
<p>Here is the link to my YouTube Channel { <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6DqGmzeoM8&amp;list=PL1pdvanb8-ka0_MlE_AQjP2aRm1vFSnjX">Link</a> } ; kindly subscribe if you enjoyed this series.</p>
<p>While I have completed the explanation of the Gnana, Karma &amp; Bhakti Yoga videos, I have realized that there is an underlying concept of perennial happiness by combining these three Yogas.</p>
<p>Before delving directly into the blog, let me summarize the prime pointers mentioned in the Video Series.</p>
<p>Re-cap of YouTube Channel First 4 Videos:</p>
<p>The root cause of unhappiness is our own thinking or thought process. Since our thought process hinders us from seeing the “world as-is” and instead, we see “the world as we want to see.”</p>
<p>Gnana Yoga: If we need to see the “world as-is,” the prime thing is not to get involved but to just observe. Such that our thought process changes from reacting to comprehending the situation.</p>
<p>Karma Yoga: After we comprehend the situation, we need to act based on the revised thought process which, in turn, is based on our comprehension.</p>
<p>Bhakti Yoga: Once we start to act on the thoughts based on comprehension rather than reaction, we tend to observe that the results of the actions we take are going in a positive direction. This, in turn, helps us to love our own thought process.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning124/version_arun_image.jpeg" class="img-fluid quarto-figure quarto-figure-center figure-img" width="693"></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p><u><strong>Blog</strong></u>:</p>
<p>Let us consider an acting profession.</p>
<p>Acting: Assume that one wants to become a good and better actor. Let us assume that he/she thinks about his/her career impartially, leading to the selection of roles with clarity in their thought process. Once he/she selects the roles, he/she gives his/her 100% in acting. However, the results are in the hands of critics and audiences, which can go either way.</p>
<p>Since he/she is clear in his/her thought process to become a better actor, he/she takes cues from past roles and learns from critics and audiences, and further implementing them in their next movie. His/Her learnings and comprehensions about being an actor improve movie after movie. He/She tries to become a better version of thyself compared to their previous movie, as their impartial thought process focuses on being a good and better actor. This makes them happier, knowing that he/she is progressing to become a better actor. Since, there is no limit for betterment; His/Her experimentation and exploration to become a better continuous till he/she strives for it. At a distance it looks like a diligent and hardworking model. However, upon closer inspection, one can discern a continuous journey of self improvement. The Ultimate happiness is about progressing thyself without future regrets. If one can take actions “now” resulting from clear thought process, that action is the first step towards happiness. Moreover, when one’s purpose is beyond their existence, their continuous action is bounded by love towards upon their “clear” thought process. This iterative process of taking incremental steps in our own life leads to various degrees of “delta happiness”, ultimately guiding us into a perpetual state of bliss.</p>
<p>I will be creating a YouTube Video as well on the similar lines in next couple of days. ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p><u><em>A few years ago,</em></u></p>
<p>A young girl in her early twenties, draped in an exquisite blue coloured silk saree, nervously waiting for her loved one outside an Engineering college.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Her dilated eyes turned misty when she saw a resembled face from a distance, and then she started flying towards him and hugged him tightly and said, “I love you, Sanjay”. { Yes, this is the same Sanjay of the first Episode }</p>
<p>“Pooja, there are so many students and lecturers around”.</p>
<p>She heard nothing but clutched him more tightly as if he would slip away from her.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sanjay responded by kissing her forehead and said, “Love you too, Pooja”,</p>
<p>After feeling his kiss, Pooja came to her senses and said, “I’m sorry, Sanjay. I couldn’t stop myself as we are meeting after a couple of years”.</p>
<p>He took her to the nearest Ganapathi mandir, which is a few miles away from his University and vowed that he would never leave her hand under any circumstances.</p>
<p>“I’m incredibly sorry that I had to ditch you because of our minor misunderstandings at that time. I never imagined you would come over again for me.”</p>
<p>“Thanks to social media, I have been following you under a ghost account for the last year. So, it was effortless to find you and your Univ. But, you never felt to look for me, Sanjay, after we broke up?”</p>
<p>“I did. But I felt guilty about what I did for you? I’m sorry,” Sanjay said as tears rolled out his eyes.</p>
<p>Pooja kissed his cheek and said, ” I love you. Let us be together again forever.”</p>
<p>“It is tough to find a loved one. It’s tougher to find a loved one who knocked on your door. How can I leave you?”</p>
<p>They hugged inside the temple as if air couldn’t pass through them. They spent their time till dawn and had a sumptuous dinner in a nearby eatery, and later Sanjay dropped her at her University, which was just two hundred miles away.</p>
<p>It took a year to find out for Pooja that Sanjay was running a parallel story along with Swati, Sanjay’s classmate.</p>
<p>She came to know this when she decided to surprise Sanjay for Valentine’s day; however, to her surprise, she saw them going into a theatre cuddling each other. At that moment, she wants to quarrel with him then. But, out of her unparalleled love towards him, she left the place in tears.</p>
<p>Pooja felt that if she showed her true love to him, he would return with unconditional love. So she waited a couple of months to see whether Sanjay would confess to his behaviour. But, it never took to that course of action.</p>
<p>Pooja doesn’t want to turn this into a bitter relationship and a nasty breakup. But chose to avoid him consistently in the name of her career and aspirations. In the beginning, it turned him off; nonetheless,&nbsp;&nbsp;having a backup, he picks to settle with Swati rather than search for true love.</p>
<p>On the other side, Pooja sobbed for months to overcome this trouble backstabbed relationship.</p>
<p><em>Back to Present in Psychotherapy Clinic</em></p>
<p>” Please wait outside or speak to my receptionist for the next queue. I’m already engaged with a client”, said Swati’s mother, the therapist.</p>
<p>Receptionist said, “Sir, there is a waiting for 30 mins. I request you to please wait in the lobby”.</p>
<p>“Sure”</p>
<p>He walked towards the lobby and saw a beautiful woman draped in a blue saree. She looked engrossed in reading a cine magazine, and it took a while for his dull mind to recognise that she was none other than Pooja.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He felt on cloud nine to see her at the right time and thanked God for this moment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>” Pooja, How are you?”</p>
<p>Pooja casually looked at Sanjay, then got excited to see him again after a couple of years and said, ” I’m amazing. How are you?”</p>
<p>” I’m fantastic too.”</p>
<p>” How come you are here, Sanjay ?”</p>
<p>” I came here for a counselling session; I’m going through a tough phase in my life. And how come you are here, Pooja? Are you here for counselling too?”</p>
<p>” No”</p>
<p>” Let me guess. Are you working here?”</p>
<p>She smiled and said, “No.&nbsp;But I’m surprised that you contemplated a counselling session. These days men are evolving as vulnerable and untrained to manage themselves.”</p>
<p>“Times change, Pooja, and men have a heart too! And I couldn’t stop flattering you; you look ravishing and stunning.”</p>
<p>Pooja beamed and said, “Thank you!!!!”</p>
<p>” It is fine. But, first, tell me why you are here?”</p>
<p>Pooja smiled and said,” I’m here for my Husband. He is presently having a counselling session with the therapist.”</p>
<p><em>&lt;&lt;&lt; To be Continued &gt;&gt;&gt;</em></p>

<p>It is about 5:45 P.M.</p>
<p>Sanjay is shifting the gears in traffic and manoeuvring his car (like a snake) in haste. He could hardly see the traffic through his misty eyes and, in an unmindful state, pulled out the mobile from his left pocket and dialled his friend Raj.</p>
<p>“Raj, can you come ASAP to our regular hangout place?”</p>
<p>Being his thickest friend from the last year, he understood the situation, felt his necessity, and said, “Sure, Sanjay. I will reach in a couple of minutes. Will be waiting for you.”</p>
<p>Car brushed the median strip and gained a dent in the rear door. However, Sanjay’s current emotions made him pay little attention to this improvement, and without stopping anywhere else, he reached the hangout place in ten minutes.</p>
<p>“Raj, can you help to order a cup of fresh ginger tea for me, please”</p>
<p>Raj went to the stall, which is adjacent to the bakery, And in ten minutes, he came with two cups of tea and placed them on the lawn seat.</p>
<p>“Sanjay, what happened? Why do you look so dull? Is it about Swathi?”</p>
<p>Sanjay behaved as if he lived too emotionally mature and could handle things efficiently.</p>
<p>“Yes”, said he and then sipped the hot tea and continued, ” she ditched me. she said she is seeing another *ss**le”.</p>
<p>“How can she do it to me, Raj? I have been with her for two years and have always given her enough space for her privacy. So is that the mistake I made?”</p>
<p>In anguish, he sipped the entire hot tea in a couple of gulps and continued, “Nevertheless, I can handle this. I will consider this moment as a blip in my personal life.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Raj’s phone vibrated, and slowly he picked up the phone from his right pocket and texted - “<em>He is with me will call you later</em>.”</p>
<p>“Raj, are u seeing a girl too?”</p>
<p>Raj responded with a shy smile and said, “Yes.”</p>
<p>“Be aware, Raj. Take me as an example. Never trust these girls blindly. For example, see how cruel Swathi is… First, she kissed me, and now she is ready to kiss another one…”</p>
<p>“Sanjay, be kind to her. She is your girlfriend”.</p>
<p>“You are right, Raj. But it isn’t any more”is”. It is her choice—preferences changes as time matures. We have to respect the same. So let it go, man.”</p>
<p>They chatted about office politics for the next half an hour and departed.</p>
<p>Sanjay reached the home safely and texted the same to Raj. Then, after having a good dinner with his parents, he went to his room and locked the room tightly and cried like a baby and slept off.</p>
<p>For the next month, he posted many motivational messages on social media and got numerous likes, ultimately leading to a boost in his self-esteem.</p>
<p>One fine working day, he took off from work and went to the theatre to watch a movie to ease his work pressures. Just before the interval, he spotted Raj and Swathi in upper corner seats, having their love time.</p>
<p>During the interval, Sanjay encountered them at the snack area, smiled, and responded, “Hey guys, hope you are having a lovely time together. Your pair is heavenly.”</p>
<p>Swathi understood his internal sarcasm and said, “I hope you are fine with our relationship.”</p>
<p>“Yea.Yea. Yeah… I am much stronger now. I have a huge career in front of me, which is more important than anything else.”</p>
<p>Sanjay acted as if he got a text message and said,&nbsp;“Guys, you have to carry on. I have to leave for work now. I just got an emergency text.” and immediately left the place with hidden frustration.</p>
<p>Again in the night, after his dinner, he went to his room and cried like a baby and slept off.</p>
<p>After thinking for a long time, he jotted down three questions, which he felt he get answers to immediately in order to reduce his worries and improve his self-esteem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;1) Why is this always happening to me?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;2) Whom should I trust?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;3) How much can I trust someone?</p>
<p>He turned to his miniature electronic device to get the answers, which re-directed him to consult a psychotherapist.</p>
<p>With the aid of the Practo App, he booked a top-rated psychotherapist who, in turn, practices far away from his home.</p>
<p>Without procrastination, he quickly drove to the place post the appointment confirmation.</p>
<p>After entering the consultant’s room, he realised that the therapist was none other than Swathi’s mother.</p>
<p>His brain triggered his famous question, “How Much I Can Trust Her?….”</p>
<p><em>&lt;&lt;&lt; To be Continued &gt;&gt;&gt;</em></p>

  <title>Glossary - 103 | Indian Culture | Sanātana Dharma</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>&nbsp;Continuing from the previous blog</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureGlossary101/" class="uri">https://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureGlossary101/</a></p></li>

</ul>
<p>_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>Before we move our identity from&nbsp;<strong>ATMAN</strong>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<strong>BRAHMAN</strong>, it is necessary to establish identity with&nbsp;<strong>ATMAN.</strong> As leading thyself comes before leading others.</p>
<p><em>We left the previous blog with this question:</em></p>
<p>But how can we move our identity to BRAHMAN? Are there any Universal rules or guiding principles?</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureGlossary103/image.png" class="img-fluid quarto-figure quarto-figure-center figure-img" width="731"></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Yes, there are Universal rules called “eternal laws” termed as&nbsp;<strong>Sanātana Dharma</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If we observe, the “Sun” is one the most prominent source of our life. How can Sun provide so much energy for generations after generations?&nbsp;</p>
<p>On a spiritual dimension, Sun is a perfect live example of “eternal laws” in action. (&nbsp;Link&nbsp;to an earlier series blog - Our Relatable Personal God )</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Sun generates the energy within</p></li>
<li><p>It gives power but doesn’t take it back.</p></li>
<li><p>It shows up every day with the same intensity.</p></li>
<li><p>It plays a prominent role in all the seasons to occur.</p></li>
<li><p>It holds together the planets of the solar system with its gravitational pull.</p></li>
<li><p>It doesn’t tell how to radiate. But powers light to reflect thyself.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>All the above sentences summarize - being in “<strong><em>Service</em></strong>” and “<strong><em>Awareness</em></strong>”. This is all about&nbsp;<strong>Sanātana Dharma.</strong></p>
<p>Alternatively, if we try to link Suns’ way of life to us, it translates as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Constant Self Inquiry leads us to a state of “Consciousness,” i.e., being with our showman. Wherein we get enlightened about ourselves.</p></li>
<li><p>Once we are enlightened, it is about giving back knowledge to the seekers through self-inquiry.</p></li>
<li><p>Results don’t matter when being in “Service”. It is about being dutiful to one’s prescribed duty.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;Above three looks familiar in our journey of the previous series of blogs. { Summarised in this version of the blog -&nbsp;Link&nbsp;}</p>
<p><strong>Sanātana Dharma</strong> is about the way of living and is not related to any religion, which is the crux of Indian culture.</p>
<p>_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p><span style="color: #6aa84f;">P.S.: Scientifically, Sun radiates its energy by nuclear fusion. It means it has to lose itself, i.e., mass, to release energy. The most exciting fact is that by the time the Sun becomes a white dwarf, it would only reduce 1% of the Sun’s mass. Thus, just 1% of the Sun’s mass generates energy for 4 billion years.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #6aa84f;">Think about being in “Self-Inquiry” for our lifetim!!!!</span></p>

  <title>Glossary - 102 | Indian Culture | Aham Brahmasmi</title>

<p>&nbsp;Continuing from the previous blog -&nbsp;<a href="https://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureGlossary101/" class="uri">Link</a></p>
<p>_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureGlossary102/image.png" class="img-fluid quarto-figure quarto-figure-center figure-img" width="357"></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p>In the previous blog, we learned about ATMAN. It is nothing but a consciousness that keeps us moving ahead. If we identify ourselves with ATMAN, ATMAN defines us.</p>
<p>If we zoom out from the unit level to the environment, there would be several ATMANs ( or consciousness ). It is like several consciousnesses trying to guide their living entity. To draw an analogy, it is like people wearing a head torch and living together. ( Head torch can be your ATMAN )</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureGlossary102/enlightment.png" class="img-fluid quarto-figure quarto-figure-center figure-img" width="610"></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p>For generations, there have been many species and lives that “the head torch has guided.” Also, surrounding us, the lives, planets, and galaxies evolved so synchronously as if there is a continuous power supply to those “head torches.” That Continuous supply of power that has powered the lives and larger universe is called&nbsp;<u><strong>BRAHMAN</strong></u>. In other words, it is also called super consciousness. ( This doesn’t mean to propagate that there is a superintelligence synchronizing the lives, but to give a context of what Brahman is. ).&nbsp;</p>
<p>In an alternative way - Even though there have been considerable changes like we are launching so many satellites, increasing the global temperature, etc.; The sun appears every day, all planets revolve around the sun, and all seasons come to us every year ( for which we depend). So irrespective of the Universal Maya, the universe constantly evolves and empowers many lives in its journey.</p>
<p>Suppose&nbsp;<strong>ATMAN</strong>&nbsp;is like recognizing the guiding light within us, which empowers us.&nbsp;<strong>BRAHMAN</strong>&nbsp;is like a guiding light for so many lives that empowers others.</p>
<p>If we move our identity from&nbsp;<strong>ATMAN</strong>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<strong>BRAHMAN</strong>, we term it “<u><strong><em>Aham Brahmasmi</em></strong></u>.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>But how can we move our identity to BRAHMAN? Are there any Universal rules or guiding principles?</p>
<p>- Answer in the next blog</p>

  <title>Glossary - 101 | Indian Culture | Atman &amp; Maya</title>

<p>Before moving to the next series, I felt like sharing some glossaries with the audience, which makes the understanding more complete and starters can connect the dots.</p>
<p>I have planned for three blog posts that will get published over the next month or so. Maybe I will add more in the future.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureGlossary101/image.png" class="img-fluid quarto-figure quarto-figure-center figure-img"></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Let us recollect the first blog of the previous series (&nbsp;<a href="https://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/learnings-indian-culture/">Link</a>). ( Rewriting a part of it which is required for this blog )</p>
<p>How do we view a movie on the Screen; Light has to fall on the movie reel which is been rotated by the wheel/motor system and in-turn that reel image is being imposed on the lens which gets enlarged and seen on the silver screen.</p>
<p>This is exactly how we see the world;&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Light is our Intelligence</p></li>
<li><p>Reel is our Thought Process or Information Available</p></li>
<li><p>Wheel is the brain that process the information or thought process</p></li>
<li><p>Lens are our senses and can be equated to Eyes</p></li>
<li><p>Screen is the world that we see</p></li>
</ul>
<p>But who is running the show?&nbsp;</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureGlossary101/learning-2.jpeg" class="img-fluid quarto-figure quarto-figure-center figure-img" width="594"></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p>In the above explanation, we see the world from our thought process or, to simply put - “We see what we want to see.” We term this as “<u><strong>MAYA</strong></u>.” It is the same “Maya” we often hear from our elders or texts, which translates to “nothing is real, but it is merely objects of our projections/perceptions.”</p>
<p>Now let us assume that there is no reel, meaning there is no thought process or information available. Then, we just ‘SEE’ it. But who helps us to see? Is it not all by ourselves? If we observe newborn kids, whenever they see something new, they stare at it for some time and respond as per the environment. As we grow, our thought process comes into play, so we PROCESS &amp; SEE. When we SEE rather than PROCESS &amp; SEE, we remove our prejudiced beliefs and start learning, accepting, and seeing new information, thus gaining more clarity of the context. As we reduce our pre-processing unit, the internal energy/force can be diverted for our benefit; therefore, enjoying a less stressful life and attaining more clarity leads to a peaceful life.</p>
<p>To remove that PROCESS from our equation requires a conscious effort. At times this happens by luck or due to survival necessity. Linking back to the movie theatre example, what do we see on the screen if there is no reel? We will see the light coming from the projector, and now the showman is running the show, but no movie is playing. Then who is the showman? Showman is that guiding force within us that wants to enlighten us. So, to meet the showman, we need to make that conscious effort to remove the MAYA. The showman or this consciousness to be aware of MAYA clutches is termed “<u><strong>ATMAN</strong></u>.” Atman means nothing but our true “<u><strong><em>Self</em></strong></u>” which wants to guide us. If we stay with Atman forever, we will be liberated and peaceful.</p>
<p>Then what is BRAHMAN?</p>
<p>– Will explain in next blog</p>
<p>________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>I hope I have tried to explain the concept in a better way and in easy way. Please leave your feedback.</p>

  <title>Extended Learnings - Summary | What Next?</title>
  <dc:creator>Arun Koundinya Parasa</dc:creator>

<section id="summary-of-24-blog-post-in-one-go" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="summary-of-24-blog-post-in-one-go"><u><em>Summary of 24 Blog Post in one go</em></u>:&nbsp;</h4>
<p>In this series of posts, we have observed Rishi, who gets enlightened through self-inquiry with a genuine inherent desire to meet the Showman; they would like to come forward to share a similar experience to his few selected disciples; thus, ‘the Rishi’ becomes ‘the Guru.’ These Rishis’ have created a way for us (via Personal God) to get liberated and realize the Showman within ourselves.</p>
<p>We learned that ‘Brahmacharya’ are the people who embark on their travel to meet the Showman. So, to get motivated to stay on the journey to pursue Showman, they started to pray to the Sun, who is more visible and tangible; and then continue their path for the ultimate Showman.</p>
<p>Rishis Disciple is now in a confusion mode ( a learning soul will always be in that way). He learned about the inner light dualities among the people and envisaged that his realization of Showman must be a Sacrifice which is nothing to sacrifice that he will realize him. His question of “why pooja” made him realize that it should not be a ritual but a method to concentrate on discovering God. Also, whatever work we do, if we perform as per the direction of Showman, we will attain peace by not thinking about the reward and living out of the vicious loop of Gunas.</p>
<p>Now Shishya is trying to learn about the pains and their conflicts. He realized that conflict is his image of the past that differs from the present. Also, the conflict will be no more only when one tries to understand the conflict. So finally, he realizes that he must come above his conflict and understand the truth.</p>
<p>He started to live with the truth that God is within us and everywhere</p>

<li>One of my close friends mentioned that the content is good; why don’t you post it as a book after completing your blog series. However, publishing a book requires much more rewriting and adding more details. In this base version of the book, I copy pasted the blogs for binge reading. We will revise this document together in a couple of years and make it better. (&nbsp;<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IizWHZjMU_vdo-wRVyBQ_oe2puL7SKse/view?pli=1">Link for the PDF</a>&nbsp;)</li>
</ul>
<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Few of you resonate that this is good to read. But, most of us cannot relate to the current status quo. So soon, in a couple of months will start writing blogs on “ Contemporary Learnings of Indian Cultures,” which will help us in the current times. I hope you may like that too.</li>

<p><u><em>Continuing from previous blogs</em></u>:</p>
<p>We have observed where the Rishi who gets enlightened through self inquiry with a true inherent desire to meet the Showman; they would like to come forward to share the similar experience to his few selected disciples; and thus ‘the Rishi’ becomes ‘the Guru’.&nbsp; Who have created a way for each and everyone of us (In terms of Personal God) to get us liberated and realize the Showman within ourselves. And then we learnt that people who embark a travel to meet the showman are termed as ‘Brahmacharya’; To get motivated to meet the showman they start to pray the Sun who is more visible and tangible; and then continue their path for the ultimate showman.</p>
<p>Rishis Disciple is now in a confusion mode asking about the inner light dualities among the people and again got into confusion when he envisaged that his realization to showman has to be Sacrificed to realize him. His question of “<em>why pooja</em>” made him to realize that it should not be a ritual but a method to concentrate to realize the god. Whatever work we do, if we perform as per direction of showman we will attain peace and not thinking about the reward and living out of vicious loop of Gunas.</p>
<p>Now Shishya is trying to learn about the pains and its conflicts. And has learnt that the conflict is his past image with respect to the present. Also, the conflict will be no more only when one tries to understand the conflict. Finally, leading him to realize that it is his duty to come above his own conflict and understand the truth. Further, trying to learn the process of being with the truth for-ever.</p>
<p>We left the previous blog with this question.</p>
<p>After a while, for a change, Guruji asks, ” Since you understood the process of attaining Truth. Can you describe the process ?”</p>
<p><span style="color: #6aa84f;"><u><strong><em>And then Rishi/Guru &amp; Shishya Dicusses in this way</em></strong></u>:</span></p>
<p>” &nbsp;Guruji, you have mentioned that the methods have to be different to attain truth. So one has to discover their methods.”</p>
<p>” Aren’t methods and process is same? ”</p>
<p>” How can it be Guruji? You have mentioned earlier that (<a href="https://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning110/">link</a>) methods are tools to realize showman. But they became mere rituals “, answered Shishya with a calmer voice.</p>
<p>” Methods got turned into rituals such that the process stays longer, but the process has lost its soul in due course”</p>
<p>Shishya looks deeper into his thought process by closing his eyes and nods his head.</p>
<p>” &nbsp;Guruji, these methods, of course, are created to realize the showman with-in, i.e., Atman. ”</p>
<p>Guruji nodded his head happily and said, ” Elaborate.”</p>
<p>” When you pray to a personal god, it means you are trying to speak to your showman. So also, when we do ‘<em>Abhishekam</em>’ with milk or water, we try to cleanse the soul and get closer to our showman. So to infer, every method is devised as a relentless effort to realize the showman with-in.”</p>
<p>Guruji felt satisfied by his responses and said, ” Then what is the process? ”</p>
<p>” Guruji, there is no process. We created the rules, but the actual process is to be with the showman in any activity we perform. ”</p>
<p>Guruji hinted to Shishya, ” In any activity that we perform? Right now, we are talking. Can this be as well ? ”</p>
<p>Shishya smiled and responded, ” Speaking to others and not to be confused with responding to others is an activity. In which we speak to a reflection of our showman with others. And whatever they speak is the real Naivedyam (&nbsp;<a href="https://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning109/">link</a>&nbsp;) to our showman itself.”</p>
<p>And Shishya continued with an enlightenment aura, ” Actually, all living beings and this entire universe are the reflections of our supreme showman. We are just a tiny part of the supreme showman. Understanding this Oneness of showman among all of us is the actual process of staying with showman forever.”</p>
<p>Guruji opened his eyes happily and said, ” Shabhash Shishya, now you are a truly enlightened person. You don’t need any other Guru. You are Guru by yourself”. Saying this, Guruji packed his bag and left the ashram on a happy note.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; — End of Guru Shishya Story —</p>

<p><u><em>Continuing from previous blogs</em></u>:</p>
<p>We have observed where the Rishi who gets enlightened through self inquiry with a true inherent desire to meet the Showman; they would like to come forward to share the similar experience to his few selected disciples; and thus ‘the Rishi’ becomes ‘the Guru’.&nbsp; Who have created a way for each and everyone of us (In terms of Personal God) to get us liberated and realize the Showman within ourselves. And then we learnt that people who embark a travel to meet the showman are termed as ‘Brahmacharya’; To get motivated to meet the showman they start to pray the Sun who is more visible and tangible; and then continue their path for the ultimate showman.</p>
<p>Rishis Disciple is now in a confusion mode asking about the inner light dualities among the people and again got into confusion when he envisaged that his realization to showman has to be Sacrificed to realize him. His question of “<em>why pooja</em>” made him to realize that it should not be a ritual but a method to concentrate to realize the god. Whatever work we do, if we perform as per direction of showman we will attain peace and not thinking about the reward and living out of vicious loop of Gunas.</p>
<p>Now Shishya is trying to learn about the pains and its conflicts. And has learnt that the conflict is his past image with respect to the present. Also, the conflict will be no more only when one tries to understand the conflict. Finally, leading him to realize that it is his duty to come above his own conflict and understand the truth.</p>
<p>We left the previous blog with this question.</p>
<p>” I understand that Guruji, but what work should I do by staying with the truth for life long other than staying in bliss. Of course, which is our ultimate goal. I mean after reaching the goal what should I do for the rest of my life. ”</p>
<p><span style="color: #6aa84f;"><u><strong><em>And then Rishi/Guru responds in this way</em></strong></u>:</span></p>
<p>” What do you want to do in your life ? ” asks Guruji.</p>
<p>Shishya closes his eyes for a few seconds and responds, ” I want to stay with Showman forever. ”</p>
<p>” If you want to stay with Showman forever, what do you have to do? ”</p>
<p>” Guruji, I have a look inward and follow my inner light. ”</p>
<p>” You are in the right direction, Shishya. So it is simple, isn’t it so? When you find your Showman, why don’t you ask him what work you have to do for the rest of your life.”</p>
<p>Shishya looks confused, and he feels he is misguided and responds sharply,</p>
<p>” What is your use of being a Guru Guruji. If you are unable to guide me.”</p>
<p>Guruji looks at Shishya and nods with a smile.</p>
<p>Guruji asks again, ” Let me reframe it for you. Showman is the highest Guru, whom you will only meet through your inward journey. So, when you meet your highest Guru, why don’t you ask him directly. Why me? ”</p>
<p>Shishya, who still looks confused, didn’t say a word.</p>
<p>Guruji continues, ” Say, for example, if your goal is to win an Olympic medal in the running. And I helped my part by coaching you. It is a fact that it is only your sheer effort that will win you many medals. However, after a certain age, you might not be able to compete in the Olympics because of several regulatory restrictions. So what would you do?”</p>
<p>“Maybe I will become a coach. (or) I participate in other competitions (or) maybe pick another sport that doesn’t have any restrictions.”</p>
<p>” Perfect! ”</p>
<p>” So, you are not stopping. You are trying to stay with your ultimate bliss through other methods or activities,” responds Guruji</p>
<p>and continues, “The Truth remains the same. So, we must understand what we need to do to stay in that Truth forever. To not to lose our connection with the Showman.”</p>
<p>” So, you mean to say that I would discover what I would do for the rest of my life only when I reach the showman.? ” asks Shishya instantly.</p>
<p>” Most of us realize the Truth. But we won’t stay in that Truth for longer periods. We understand what it is but seldom comprehend it. ” responds Guruji with a calm and pleasant smile.</p>
<p>and continued, ” What do you have to do if you need to comprehend the ultimate truth.”</p>
<p>Shishya delves into his deep thinking and responds with his eyes closed, ” If I understood the process that made me realize the Truth. Then I will try to hinge on that process to stay in a more extended period or forever with the Truth. The process is like preparing for running, and the goal is like winning medals. ”</p>
<p>And Shishya continues in his heightened realization, ” When resolving our internal conflict, we understand only the temporary Truth. It isn’t possible to stay in that provisional Truth. But when we know the process of determining the conflict. We come above the conflict and remain with the Truth forever. Ultimately, this is the “process” that will stay with me for my journey for the rest of my life. Dhanyotsmi Guruji! ”</p>
<p>After a while, for a change, Guruji asks, ” Since you understood the process of attaining Truth. Can you describe the process ?”</p>

<p>Now Shishya is trying to learn about the pains and its conflicts. And has learnt that the conflict is his past image with respect to the present. Also, the conflict will be no more only when one tries to understand the conflict.</p>
<p>We left the previous blog with this question.</p>
<p>Shishya started to ponder to what Guruji said and in few minutes he asks, ” If I just live around these conflicts and try to understand them, when can I reach an ultimate bliss situation and realize the showman. I doubt is there a showman in reality ? ”</p>
<p><span style="color: #6aa84f;"><u><strong><em>And then Rishi/Guru responds in this way</em></strong></u>:</span></p>
<p>” Who has created these conflicts? ” asks Guruji.</p>
<p>Shishya, instead of reacting instantly, thinks calmly for a few seconds and responds, ” As you said Guruji, conflicts are created in our mind to our past. So, conflict is our creation. ”</p>
<p>” If you want to enjoy the conflict! what do you have to do? ”</p>
<p>” Guruji, that is an absurd question. How can one enjoy the conflict? ”</p>
<p>” You are not thinking Shishya. Give it a thought you have the answer. ”</p>
<p>Shishya closes his eyes for a minute; and he opens his eyes as if he got enlightened and responds, ” As you have said Guruji, conflict can be reduced when we try to understand the conflict. However, to enjoy the conflict we have to come above the conflict and start loving the process of learning the conflict ”</p>
<p>Guruji looks so revealed with his answers and smiles happily with a nod.</p>
<p>Guruji asks again, ” What makes you ponder, that is there a showman in reality or not? ”</p>
<p>” If there is in reality, you would be describing him and not the path to realizing him. Also, if there is one showman there would not be different religions ”</p>
<p>” Showman or truth is the same ”</p>
<p>” I could not comprehend your context, Guruji ”</p>
<p>” Our goal for showman is to reach a state of ultimate bliss, which in itself is the highest truth ” responds Guruji while sipping water</p>
<p>and continues, ” Truth remains the same. However, the path to understanding the truth might differ. I teach you my paths and others teach theirs. ”</p>
<p>” But why does it take so many years for your disciples to realize the truth ? ” asks Shishya instantly</p>
<p>” If they follow my path, they will understand my truth but not theirs’ ” responds Guruji with a calm and pleasant smile.</p>
<p>Shishya closes his eyes and goes into deep thinking and asks, ” Dhanyotsmi Gurudeva, I understand the starting point of the truth. If I have realized the showman, I have to come above the paths that you mentioned and create my path for him ”</p>
<p>Guruji nods his head and says, ” A while ago, when I have said to rethink on conflict. Instead of giving up you thought and responded and which is better than my answer. Remember, the entire cosmic is your brain. You have to make it light to make the best use for your happiness ”</p>
<p>After a while, shishya asks, ” What do I have to do after I realize the truth ”</p>
<p>This time Guruji replies, ” You stay with the truth ” instantaneously.&nbsp;</p>
<p>” I understand that Guruji, but what work should I do by staying with the truth for life long other than staying in bliss. Of course, which is our ultimate goal. I mean after reaching the goal what should I do for the rest of my life. ”</p>

<p><u><em>Continuing from previous blogs</em></u>:</p>
<p>We have observed where the Rishi who gets enlightened through self inquiry with a true inherent desire to meet the Showman; they would like to come forward to share the similar experience to his few selected disciples; and thus ‘the Rishi’ becomes ‘the Guru’.&nbsp; Who have created a way for each and everyone of us (In terms of Personal God) to get us liberated and realize the Showman within ourselves. And then we learnt that people who embark a travel to meet the showman are termed as ‘Brahmacharya’; To get motivated to meet the showman they start to pray the Sun who is more visible and tangible; and then continue their path for the ultimate showman.</p>
<p>Rishis Disciple is now in a confusion mode asking about the inner light dualities among the people and again got into confusion when he envisaged that his realization to showman has to be Sacrificed to realize him. His question of “<em>why pooja</em>” made him to realize that it should not be a ritual but a method to concentrate to realize the god. Whatever work we do, if we perform as per direction of showman we will attain peace and not thinking about the reward and living out of vicious loop of Gunas.</p>
<p>Now Shishya is trying to learn about the pains and its conflicts. And has learnt that the conflict is his past image with respect to the present.</p>
<p>We left the previous blog with this question.</p>
<p>Shishya looks as if his quench for knowledge is done. However, within a moment with his unrest expression, ” It looks good on paper, would that be possible or is it a practical solution? ”</p>
<p><span style="color: #6aa84f;"><u><strong><em>And then Rishi/Guru responds in this way</em></strong></u>:</span></p>
<p>” What makes you putative about our discussion? ” asks Guruji.</p>
<p>” It is like filling up the pond with river water. However, the river is 50 km away from the pond; and we have to fill using our cupped hands !! Vision is good, but it looks highly impossible that I doubt to pour even a drop in our lifetime. ”</p>
<p>” Superb! Then what did you realize from our discussions? ” asks Guruji with his usual serene smile.</p>
<p>” I have just realized that; it is not practical to follow your suggestions! ” says Shishya with a lot of intensity</p>
<p>” Superb!&nbsp; Let me help you here. In our discussion so far, what is the fact, and what is the opinion? ”</p>
<p>Shishya closed his eyes and responded,&nbsp; ” Fact is the realization that&nbsp;we get influenced/biased from our past. The opinion is one that where you have referred that we need to start from a fresh slate of mind in every moment of our life. ”</p>
<p>” So, you are deferring the opinion but not the fact. Am I right? ”</p>
<p>” Yes. That is the reason I have said it is not practical! “&nbsp;</p>
<p>” Good. If you agree that the fact is truth will that not help you? ”</p>
<p>” I need a solution !! ” responds Shishya with exacting intensity</p>
<p>Guruji smiles and responds, ” I will give you the solution that has worked for me. And you are saying that is not practical. So, I will be anachronistic as per your comprehension ”</p>
<p>” But I need a solution Guruji ! ” responds Shishya</p>
<p>” Let me tell you one more fact, in a hurry to look for a solution we do not internalize the fact. So, our realization will be in words but not inside our minds. So ideally, there might be several solutions available for our problems but none seems working for us. Consequentially, we either live with the fact or defer the fact. ”</p>
<p>” I can connect to this. But why does others’ solution doesn’t seem to be a right fit for us? ”</p>
<p>” Likewise there are several methods to realize god&nbsp;<em>{<a href="https://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning110/">refer earlier blog</a>}</em>&nbsp;there are several solutions to a problem. If we concentrate on methods we can never reach the end goal of ours but we might be reaching or working for someone else’s; which is of course not the solution we are looking for. “&nbsp; responds Guruji</p>
<p>” How can I find my solution? Your solution is very impractical and others’ solutions would be like a patch fix for that conflict. ”</p>
<p>” Wonderful Shishya!&nbsp; I would recommend that instead of finding the solution; try to learn more about your conflict and understand its roots.” answers Guruji to incite interest in Shishya.</p>
<p>Shishya started to ponder to what Guruji said and in few minutes he asks, ” If I just live around these conflicts and try to understand them, when can I reach an ultimate bliss situation and realize the showman. I doubt is there a showman in reality ? ”</p>

<p><u><em>Continuing from previous blogs</em></u>:</p>
<p>We have observed where the Rishi who gets enlightened through self inquiry with a true inherent desire to meet the Showman; they would like to come forward to share the similar experience to his few selected disciples; and thus ‘the Rishi’ becomes ‘the Guru’.&nbsp; Who have created a way for each and everyone of us (In terms of Personal God) to get us liberated and realize the Showman within ourselves.

<p>Rishis Disciple is now in a confusion mode asking about the inner light dualities among the people and again got into confusion when he envisaged that his realization to showman has to be Sacrificed to realize him.

Whatever work we do, if we perform as per direction of showman we will attain peace and not thinking about the reward and living out of vicious loop of Gunas.</p>
<p>Now Shishya is trying to learn about the pains and its conflicts.</p>
<p>We left the previous blog with this question.</p>
<p>After few moments, ” How can we get out of the conflict zone!! Guruji. “,&nbsp; asks Shishya restlessly.</p>
<p><span style="color: #6aa84f;"><u><strong><em>And then Rishi/Guru responds in this way</em></strong></u>:</span></p>
<p>Guruji smiles and responds, ” How do you define a zone? ”</p>
<p>” It means a territory; I’m assuming that you want me to re-define my question. Here it goes, how to get out of the conflict-territory that we habitually dwell?”</p>
<p>Guruji again responds with serene smile, ” Don’t dwell in that territory? “&nbsp;</p>
<p>” What would be the course. If we cannot come out of that territory? ”</p>
<p>Guruji quickly answers, ” This statement conflicts with your question itself. A while ago, you want to come out of that zone and now you are insisting that you cannot come out of that zone. Succinctly, you are pre-meditated to dwell in the conflict zone “&nbsp;</p>
<p>Shishya pauses for a minute and closes his eyes and pray, ” Guruji, let me rephrase my question. How to avoid being in that conflict zone ? ”</p>
<p>” Picking up from our earlier conversation (<a href="https://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning118/"><em>last blog</em></a>),&nbsp; conflict arises due to the interaction effect of past to present. Ideally, we have to start with a fresh slate of mind every moment in our life! ”</p>
<p>Shishya interrupted with anxiety and asked, ” Are you saying that we should have a consistent memory loss ”</p>
<p>Guruji says while he is signalling to sit on the bench,” That dead tree has become this bench with the aid of our memory. I don’t underestimate the power of our minds. What I mean is not to ax all the living trees because Guruji is enjoying his comfort on that bench. As we have formed an opinion based on what we observe from the original fact in the entire prejudice hierarchy ”</p>

<p><em>Watch from the 6th Minute onwards</em></p>
<p>Guruji continues, ” The conflict surfaces whenever we accept our opinions, our beliefs, and our so-called&nbsp; prejudices as mere facts. And this assumed fact will have a conflict with reality, as it is not the fact. To avoid that conflict we should have a fresh slate of mind, which means to stop forming opinions and just observe. ”</p>
<p>Shishya looks as if his quench for knowledge is done. However, within a moment with his unrest expression, ” It looks good on paper, would that be possible or is it a practical solution? ”</p>

Whatever work we do, if we perform as per direction of showman we will attain peace and not thinking about the reward and living out of vicious loop of Gunas.</p>
<p>We left the previous blog with this question.</p>
<p>Shishya who is still unrest, ” Then it looks like pain is inevitable as most of us cannot realize the Showman ? ” asked Guruji; as his quench for knowledge is huge.</p>
<p><span style="color: #6aa84f;"><u><strong><em>And then Rishi/Guru responds in this way</em></strong></u>::</span></p>
<p>” How does the pain start ? ”</p>
<p>” Whenever we get hurt deeply, Guruji ”</p>
<p>” I do perceive the unpleasant physical sensation when we get hurt physically. Is this what you are referring to ? ”</p>
<p>Shishya became flummoxed for a minute as he is unable to comprehend to what Guruji is referring to. However,&nbsp;he said ” Guruji, I’m referring to the mental pain and not the physical pain ”</p>
<p>” What does it hurt internally ”</p>
<p>Shishya got peeved and said, ” It hurts me Guruji !!! ”</p>
<p>” I understand that. However, i do know which part gets hurt when it is physical. How do i know what gets hurt when i’m suffering from mental pain ? ”</p>
<p>” I feel it is heart. It gets heavier when i get hurt ”</p>
<p>” Why does the heart gets hurt ?” asks Guruji without any procrastination.</p>
<p>” It gets so because it got hurt. I’m sorry Guruji I don’t know where this conservation is leading to ? ” asked Shishya with a mixed of puzzled and annoyed facial expressions.</p>
<p>Guruji smiled and said, ” Irony is that we don’t know what it gets hurt, but we get hurt. Isn’t it so interesting to know this “&nbsp;</p>
<p>” Then what is the reason that we experience so much pain ? “&nbsp;</p>
<p>” Our past gets into a big conflict with respect to the present or may be envisaged future. The magnitude of the conflict determines our pain. As we face many conflicts in our daily life we do face the varied range of pains and few may be worse. ” Guruji paused for a second and continued,</p>
<p>” Also, we realize that the grey hair gets more endured to pain than younger ones because the more we face the pain the more we get endured to manage that particular conflict within ourselves ”</p>
<p>” What is that conflict Guruji “,&nbsp; asks Shishya enthusiastically now</p>
<p>“&nbsp; As I have said earlier, the conflict is with respect to our past. In other terms we can call it as a memory or the image that we stored in our brains. We usually identify more with respect to that memory or image, so consequentially we get into a conflict zone whenever a new information or data questions the identity of that image. Thus, resulting the so called&nbsp;<strong>mental</strong>&nbsp;<strong>pain</strong>&nbsp;”</p>
<p>” I do realize this Guruji, the moment I discover that that is a reaction of my past my nerves become calmer”</p>
<p>” That true!!! Once we realize the cause of any pain. We cure it ” said Guruji as both of them were on the way to the river banks for evening strolls.</p>
<p>After few moments, ” How can we get out of the conflict zone!! Guruji. “,&nbsp; asks Shishya restlessly.</p>

<p><u><em>Continuing from previous blogs</em></u>:</p>
<p>We have observed where the Rishi who gets enlightened through self inquiry with a true inherent desire to meet the Showman; they would like to come forward to share the similar experience to his few selected disciples; and thus ‘the Rishi’ becomes ‘the Guru’.&nbsp; Who have created a way for each and everyone of us (In terms of Personal God) to get us liberated and realize the Showman within ourselves. And then we learnt that people who embark a travel to meet the showman are termed as ‘Brahmacharya’; To get motivated to meet the showman they start to pray the Sun who is more visible and tangible; and then continue their path for the ultimate showman.</p>
<p>Rishis Disciple is now in a confusion mode asking about the inner light dualities among the people and again got into confusion when he envisaged that his realization to showman has to be Sacrificed to realize him. His question of “<em>why pooja</em>” made him to realize that it should not be a ritual but a method to concentrate to realize the god. Whatever work we do, if we perform as per direction of showman we will attain peace and not thinking about the reward and living out of vicious loop of Gunas.</p>
<p>We left the previous blog with this question.</p>
<p>Whilst in midst of his nap shishya woke up suddenly and ran to his master and asked, ” What happens in the due course if our actions hurt others ? “&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #6aa84f;"><u><strong><em>And then Rishi/Guru responds in this way</em></strong></u>::</span></p>
<p>” What is the point of reference when you say, “<em>our actions hurt others</em>” ”</p>
<p>” As I look at it, reference point doesn’t make sense here. Each and everyone of us gets hurt by actions of each other. ” Shishya replied haughtily.</p>
<p>Yet again, Guruji asked the same questions in an equable manner, ” What is the point of reference when you say, “<em>our actions hurt others</em>” ”</p>
<p>Shishya continued in the same manner and this time changed his answer in haste and said, ” Okie. Let us assume it is from my point of reference? ”</p>
<p>” Are you saying that you are getting hurt, because someone either intentionally or unintentionally is hurting you ? “&nbsp;</p>
<p>” Yup. This is what I’m trying to convey to you ” said shishya.</p>
<p>Guruji smiled and replied, ” So, their actions tend to hurt you. Am I right in my understanding. ”</p>
<p>” Yes. However, not all actions. At times. ”</p>
<p>” At times, their actions either intentionally or unintentionally is hurting you. Am I near in framing the right problem statement ?&nbsp;“, Guruji responded with Smile.</p>
<p>Shishya said, ” Yes “, with confusion at heart.</p>
<p>” In your point of reference, those actions are not acceptable and thus it is hurting you. What happens if your point of reference for those actions are wrong ? ”</p>
<p>Shishya reacted by saying, ” It is a possibility. ”</p>
<p>Guruji said, ” So, you are saying that your happiness is married on someone actions rather than with the realization of Showman ? ”</p>
<p>Shishya calmed his senses and asked, ” I understood where this is leading to. What if we change the point of reference i.e.; if my actions are hurting others ? ”</p>
<p>Guruji said, ” If you are asking this question. I’m assuming that you are in a profession that hurts others like say in war/parenting etc.;. On the other side, if you are hurting someone passionately and acting modestly with the same person is a hypocritical living. ”</p>
<p>Shishya nodded his head as a signal to continue.</p>
<p>” Conflict arise in our mind, when our thinking reference dilly-dallying in our mind. Intent and identity of our action changes when the reference changes to our Supreme Showman.”</p>
<p>” As we were discussing a while earlier ( previous blogs ), identity realization liberates us.”</p>
<p>Shishya who is still unrest, ” Then it looks like pain is inevitable as most of us cannot realize the Showman ? ” asked Guruji; as his quench for knowledge is huge.</p>
<p>— Answer in next blog</p>

<p>This particular blog has been a learning lesson for me. Hope you might provide some valuable suggestions and improvements; if any.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: #2b00fe; color: #fcff01;"><strong><em>Let that be known by the name of Yoga, the severance from union with pain. This Yoga should be practiced with determination and with heart undismayed&nbsp;{&nbsp;Bhagavad Gita 6.23}</em></strong></span></p>

  <title>Extended Learnings -116 | Indian Culture | Which Guna Out of the Three Gunas is Best?</title>

<p><u><em>Continuing from previous blogs</em></u>:</p>

His question of “<em>why pooja</em>” made him to realize that it should not be a ritual but a method to concentrate to realize the god. Whatever work we do, if we perform as per direction of showman we will attain peace and not thinking about the reward for the work.</p>
<p>We left the previous blog with this question.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Shishya thinks deeply for a while and questions Guruji as , ” I Understand Guruji, but if we are not led by our thoughts would it not be leading to our ignorance. Which you usually refer to as Tamasa Guna? “&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #6aa84f;"><u><strong><em>And then Rishi/Guru responds in this way</em></strong></u>::</span></p>
<p>” Where does your thoughts originate from shishya ? ”</p>
<p>” Inside my brain ” replied shishya effortlessly.</p>
<p>” What is there inside your brain that ushered to those thoughts? ”</p>
<p>Shishya with an ambiguous face answered, ” It is a cryptic one for me Guruji ”</p>
<p>” Let me do my best to unravel this mystery for you. Ideally, brain is considered to be a storage of information, and thoughts germinate from this information.” replied Guruji with a placid smile on his face.</p>
<p>” Even if the incremental information is miniscule, why do we have different thoughts at different times ? ” asked shishya with a defiant body language.</p>
<p>Guruji smiled and replied, ” Thoughts originate under the external influence with the aid of our senses ”</p>
<p>Shishya’s mood got chilled as if a bucket of cold water was poured from top of this head, ” What happens next ? ”</p>
<p>” Depending upon the external stimuli on our senses, our thoughts may either respond/react positively, negatively or passionately. From these thoughts our actions/buddhi arise which we discussed in our&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guṇa">Gunas</a>&nbsp;class.&nbsp;“, Guruji responded with ease to what shishya supposed to an arcane one.</p>
<p>Shishya with a burdened mind asked, ” Since, we will be under constant influence on external environment, isn’t it would be difficult for us to come out of the vicious loop of these Gunas. ”</p>
<p>” Methods that we have learnt so far acts as a&nbsp;preliminary step to repudiate this vicious loop. i.e.; to have very less to negligible influence of our memory of the past with respect to our present ”</p>
<p>Shishya reacted with instant enlightenment, ” I’m able to connect the pieces Guruji. If we only raise above to these three Gunas only then we will be guided by our showman. ” and reminded this poem.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: #2b00fe; color: #fcff01;"><em>“When one rises above the three gunas that originate in the body;</em></span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #2b00fe; color: #fcff01;"><em>one is freed from birth, old age, disease, and death; and attains enlightenment” (Bhagavad Gita 14.20)</em></span></p>
<p>Guruji started to move to the dining area and on the way he said, ” Ignorance/Inertia is a choice made by ourselves based on external stimuli. Most of our life we are ignorant of many lives around us and we are wielded in darkness ”</p>
<p>After an hour…</p>
<p>Whilst in midst of his nap shishya woke up suddenly and ran to his master and asked, ” What happens in the due course if our actions hurt others ? ”</p>

<li><p>Don’t give medication (antibiotic does not aid virus battle; steroid will suppress immunity and prolong viral infection)</p></li>
<li><p>Optional health supplement</p></li>
<li><p>80% of people will recover by now. 20% of people take a dangerous turn…</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Phase 2)</em></strong>&nbsp;Day 6 to 10: immune system attacks blood vessels in the lungs; leading to blood clot (no longer virus battle)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Symptoms: deep hacking dry cough, rising/returning fever. Note: this is not pneumonia (yet). Warning: Don’t wait for home-digital sensor to register a drop in oxygen saturation. Don’t wait until breathless. Go hospital early.</p></li>
<li><p>Administer steroid (5 days) and anti-coagulant (3 weeks) under medical watch. Address cytokine shower to prevent cytokine storm (will need ventilator by then).</p></li>
<li><p>Most patient will feel remarkably better when steroid is started, and will go on to recover.</p></li>
<li><p>However by day 5, fever and breathlessness may return in elderly, diabetic or weakened patients who enter into Phase 3….</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Phase 3)</em></strong>&nbsp;After 5 days on steroid, suppressed immunity develop into bacteria infection. This is now pneumonia.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Administer antibiotics and pneumonia medications</li>
</ul>
<p><u><em>The most important takeaway from this video is that</em></u>&nbsp;- Steroids would invite opportunistic infections which are already present in our body system; And whose immune system is compromised would take a more dangerous turn. So, Abusing Steroids will abuse our own health system or even life if it not administered under the supervision of a registered practitioner.</p>
<p>Also, Abusing Antibiotic usage as well would lead bacteria inside our body to become Antibiotic resistance.</p>

<p>Steroids which belong to the family of Immuno Suppressant Drugs has been prevalent over 50 years in the human history and have proved to be a life saving drugs for various risky auto-immune situations { Like Multiple Sclerosis, Psoriasis, Type 1 Diabetes,&nbsp;Rheumatoid Arthritis etc.; }</p>

<p>Primary role of the Immuno Suppresant Drugs is to target the Hyper Active components of the immune system and avoid damage of our own cells thus saving US.</p>
<p>Also, these drugs are as well used to in cadavers to keep organs alive which is useful for organ transplantation. Also, the same drug is given to the person who needs this organ.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-is-mucormycosis-why-it-is-been-trending-now">What is MucorMycosis? Why it is been trending now&nbsp; ?</h3>
<p>Mucormycetes, the group of fungi that cause mucormycosis, are present throughout the environment,. Mucormycosis is a very rare infection. It is caused by exposure to mucor mould which is commonly found in soil, plants, manure, and decaying fruits and vegetables. The fungi are often also found in indoor and outdoor air, in food stuffs, and in dust.</p>
<p>A Condition of MucorMycosis appears in different parts of the body depending upon the predisposing condition.</p>

</div>
<p>Most of the cases that are registered in India seemed to be of Rhino-Cerebral; So, the doctors assumed that it is because either because of early usage of Steroids or Steroid Abuse.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So accordingly, Doctors believe Mucormycosis, which has an overall mortality rate of 50%, may be being triggered by the use of steroids.&nbsp;</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-does-happens-when-it-enters-our-body.-is-it-so-deadly">What does happens when it enters our body. Is it so deadly&nbsp; ?</h3>
<p>In Majority of the cases it is assumed to have entered from air through our nose.&nbsp; Patients suffering from this fungal infection typically have symptoms:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>stuffy and bleeding nose</p></li>
<li><p>swelling of and pain in the eye</p></li>
<li><p>drooping of eyelids; and&nbsp;</p></li>
<li><p>blurred and finally, loss of vision.&nbsp;</p></li>
<li><p>There could be black patches of skin around the nose.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It is considered to be a deadly disease because if we defect/react to these symptoms late; It might lead to removal of organs like jaws or eyes; If further delay might damage brain cells leading to death.</p>
<p>However, the most bright fact is that it will not be dangerous for majority of the healthy people and normal people; It will effect the people whose immune systems has been severely compromised.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-are-the-most-important-reasons-for-this-spike-now">What are the&nbsp; most important reasons for this spike now ?</h3>
<p>As mentioned and discussed above, the prime understanding among the doctors based on the earlier data is that the abusive usage of corticosteroids will lead to this Fungal infection. Since, most of the people are having home treatment for COVID under no medico supervision there would be case of early usage or repetitive usage of them leading to a compromised immune system in our body. Since, the cases of COVID has surged due to new strain it is logical to assume for the same.</p>
<p>However, there are specific theories who also assume that the usage of steroids or abusive usage has happened in the past; But not have seen so many Fungal Infection Cases. { Also, we know from one of our earlier blogs that people who die in India with underlying reasons of Diabetics are approx. 2000 per day }</p>
<p>A recent study by kerala doctor suggests the following three reasons; {&nbsp;<em>As per the study of 200 people 15% did not used steroids</em>&nbsp;}</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The first line of defence for Mucor is Nose. When we inhale steam excessively there is high possibility of damaging epithelial cells;&nbsp; Which is like a free entry for any bacteria or fungus into our body directly.</p></li>
<li><p>100% of the people has used Antibiotics like&nbsp;Azithromycin, Doxycycline which made the existing bacteria and fungal becoming resistant and got an opportunity to infect our body after few days when our immune system is compromised.</p></li>
<li><p>Usually, fungus thrive in zinc rich environments; Unnoticed and heavy administration of zinc supplements would also invite the fungus to grow inside our body.</p></li>
<li><p>A Combination of all of these things would also, lead to the severity of the case.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="conclusions" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusions">Conclusions:</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><u><strong><em>The Thumb rule remains the same</em></strong></u>; The patient cannot be a registered doctor and prescribe himself by browsing on internet. The drugs has to be administered as per dosage levels, interval levels and for a specific duration from the onset of the disease.</p></li>
<li><p>It is important to note that this fungus is available on soil spores as well; When cow eats grass from the soil spores; This fungus gets into their digestive system and then finds its outward via manure; So, administrating or handling excess of this or when using steroids will be like a welcome bell.</p></li>
<li><p>It is as well recommended to be in hygienic environment when you are under administration of steroids.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, Steam as we learnt above has to be avoided in excess; However, for many of them might not damage the epithelial cells; But certainly dehydrate the body to a large extent if done for longer times in a day.&nbsp;</p></li>
<li><p>Request to have lesser dependence on Whatsapp Forwards and depend on experienced doctor.</p></li>
<li><p>Also, a massive study is being conducted by Israel Scientists on Steroids for our future safety.</p></li>

<p><u><em>Continuing from previous blogs</em></u>:</p>
<p>We have observed where the Rishi who gets enlightened through self inquiry with a true inherent desire to meet the Showman; they would like to come forward to share the similar experience to his few selected disciples; and thus ‘the Rishi’ becomes ‘the Guru’.&nbsp; Who have created a way for each and everyone of us (In terms of Personal God) to get us liberated and realize the Showman within ourselves. And then we learnt that people who embark a travel to meet the showman are termed as ‘Brahmacharya’; To get motivated to meet the showman they start to pray the Sun who is more visible and tangible; and then continue their path for the ultimate showman.</p>
<p>Rishis Disciple is now in a confusion mode asking about the inner light dualities among the people and again got into confusion when he envisaged that his realization to showman has to be Sacrificed to realize him. His question of “<em>why pooja</em>” made him to realize that it should not be a ritual but a method to concentrate to realize the god. Whatever work we do, if we perform as per direction of showman we will attain peace.</p>
<p>We left the previous with this question.</p>
<p>&nbsp;” Dhanyotsmi Guruji, But how would we know that&nbsp;<em>this is the work</em>&nbsp;of HIS thoughts ? ” Asks Shishya with excitement and love.</p>
<p><span style="color: #6aa84f;"><u><strong><em>And then Rishi/Guru responds in this way</em></strong></u>::</span></p>
<p>” How do you differentiate between HIS work and our work? ”</p>
<p>Complacent Shishya said, ” As you always mention Guruji, If it is driven by our thought process it can be termed as our work; If it is driven by HIS thought process it can be termed as Showmans work”</p>
<p>Guruji smiled and asked, ” Then how do you differentiate&nbsp;between HIS thought process and Ours ? ”</p>
<p>” May be Ours is shallow; And Showman’s might be more holistic ? ”</p>
<p>Guruji again smiled and said, ” It is interesting that you are picking new terms and using them. Are you sure about the content that you intend to communicate ? ”</p>
<p>Shishya nods his head with confidence.</p>
<p>” We need to understand that there is nothing called as shallow or holistic in Showman’s thought process. It is just HIS thought process; The derivations to shallow or holistic is ours and not His”</p>
<p>” Then what is it Guruji ?”</p>
<p>Guruji went to the farm to pluck few vegetables, Shishya followed along with him ” How do you feel, when you eat what you want or love ? ”</p>
<p>” I feel happy Guruji. “’</p>
<p>” How do you feel when you drink Kashaya every morning ? ”</p>
<p>” Honestly, I didn’t liked it Guruji; As you mentioned that it is good for my health. I stopped relating to the drink and simply drank it ”</p>
<p>” Interesting Pattern ”</p>
<p>Guruji picked couple of Vegetables and walked back; and continued , ” Drawing some parallel lines, when we get attached to the reward ( <em>either intrinsic or extrinsic</em> ) it directly means that the work we are performing is run by our thoughts. Consequently, when we are unattached by the rewards, it is indirectly run by HIS thoughts for&nbsp;<span style="color: blue"><strong><em>LokaSamgraha</em></strong></span>”</p>
<p>” Guruji, what reward do we get ? ” Asks Shishya with slight commotion.</p>
<p>” Human Life itself is the biggest reward.&nbsp;It is always wise to be in constant touch with him in any work we do; And the reward of the work is attributed to him.”</p>
<p>Shishya thinks deeply for a while and questions Guruji as , ” I Understand Guruji, but if we are not led by our thoughts would it not be leading to our ignorance ; which you usually refer to as Tamasa Guna? “&nbsp;</p>

<p><u><em>Continuing from previous blogs</em></u>:</p>
<p>We have observed where the Rishi who gets enlightened through self inquiry with a true inherent desire to meet the Showman; they would like to come forward to share the similar experience to his few selected disciples; and thus ‘the Rishi’ becomes ‘the Guru’.&nbsp; Who have created a way for each and everyone of us (In terms of Personal God) to get us liberated and realize the Showman within ourselves. And then we learnt that people who embark a travel to meet the showman are termed as ‘Brahmacharya’; To get motivated to meet the showman they start to pray the Sun who is more visible and tangible; and then continue their path for the ultimate showman.</p>
<p>Rishis Disciple is now in a confusion mode asking about the inner light dualities among the people and again got into confusion when he envisaged that his realization to showman has to be Sacrificed to realize him. His question of “<em>why pooja</em>” made him to realize that it should not be a ritual but a method to concentrate to realize the god.</p>
<p>We left the previous blog where Shishya approaches to Guruji and asks , ” If everyone is looking to realize the showman to achieve the state of bliss, Who will do the work Guruji and keep the world running ? ”</p>
<p><span style="color: #6aa84f;"><u><strong><em>And then Rishi/Guru responds in this way</em></strong></u>:</span> {&nbsp;<em>This answer will be answered through conversations in next three blogs; This is second one - conversation continued from&nbsp; 1)&nbsp;<a href="https://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning112/">first one</a>&nbsp;2)&nbsp;<a href="https://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning113/">second one</a></em>] }</p>
<p>Guruji Says, ” What is inward looking according to you? ”</p>
<p>Shishya replies, ” As per my short experience, i would like to say it is about tracing back our thought process and correcting it ”</p>
<p>Guruji felt happy for his answer and says, ” Very Good. To add on it is ideally having no thought process and seeing the things as it is ”</p>
<p>Shishya from his unrest state moved to confusion state which is vividly visible on his facial expressions. And he enquires Guruji , ” Guruji, How can we don’t have a thought process ”</p>
<p>” When you achieve that state, you are said to be in a constant connection with the showman. His thought process will become our action. The results of the actions is a reward to his thought process. So, we become his tool to convert his thoughts to action. ”</p>
<p>As Shishya is still in confusion mode; Guruji continues, ” Coming to what Inward Journey means; It is the Journey to our Showman. When you are guided by him every moment our life life becomes a blissful journey.”</p>
<p>” If people don’t get the rewarded; how would they get motivated to do their work on daily basis “&nbsp; Asks Shishya with a mix of Confusion and Excitement.</p>
<p>“&nbsp;<span style="color: blue"><strong><em>LokaSamgraha</em></strong></span>&nbsp;is what you have mentioned earlier which has to be a consistent acts for generations. For such to happen we have to uncomplicate the life within us; which would only happen when we try to start an inward journey” {&nbsp;This is the Summary for&nbsp;<em>1)&nbsp;<a href="https://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning112/">first one</a>&nbsp;2)&nbsp;<a href="https://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning113/">second one</a></em> &nbsp;}</p>
<p>And Guruji Continues, ” If the act of&nbsp;<span style="color: blue"><strong><em>LokaSamgraha</em></strong></span>&nbsp;is the thought process of the showman. What more reward do we need it !!! ”</p>
<p>Shishya who was in a state of excitement, suddenly became calm as if a bucket of cold water has been poured on his head.</p>
<p>After a short pause; Shishya says, ” I now understand Guruji, We are just tools to our showman; as you mentioned that the world has been running on its own for millions of years; by the guidance and thought process of Showman itself. We are here to execute his thoughts to fullest extent and make the world more lively for future generations.”</p>
<p>Guruji Smiled with Satisfaction;</p>
<p>” Dhanyotsmi Guruji, But how would be know that&nbsp;<em>this is the work</em>&nbsp;of HIS thoughts ? ” Asks Shishya with excitement and love.</p>
