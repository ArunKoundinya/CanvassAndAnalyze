In the previous blog, we learned about ATMAN. It is nothing but a consciousness that keeps us moving ahead. If we identify ourselves with ATMAN, ATMAN defines us.

If we zoom out from the unit level to the environment, there would be several ATMANs ( or consciousness ). It is like several consciousnesses trying to guide their living entity. To draw an analogy, it is like people wearing a head torch and living together. ( Head torch can be your ATMAN )

![](enlightment.png){fig-align="center" width="610"}

For generations, there have been many species and lives that "the head torch has guided." Also, surrounding us, the lives, planets, and galaxies evolved so synchronously as if there is a continuous power supply to those "head torches." That Continuous supply of power that has powered the lives and larger universe is called [**BRAHMAN**]{.underline}. In other words, it is also called super consciousness. ( This doesn't mean to propagate that there is a superintelligence synchronizing the lives, but to give a context of what Brahman is. ). 

In an alternative way - Even though there have been considerable changes like we are launching so many satellites, increasing the global temperature, etc.; The sun appears every day, all planets revolve around the sun, and all seasons come to us every year ( for which we depend). So irrespective of the Universal Maya, the universe constantly evolves and empowers many lives in its journey.

Suppose **ATMAN** is like recognizing the guiding light within us, which empowers us. **BRAHMAN** is like a guiding light for so many lives that empowers others.

If we move our identity from **ATMAN** to **BRAHMAN**, we term it "[***Aham Brahmasmi***]{.underline}." 

But how can we move our identity to BRAHMAN? Are there any Universal rules or guiding principles?
