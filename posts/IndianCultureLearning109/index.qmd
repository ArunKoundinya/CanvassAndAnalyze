[*Continuing from previous blogs*]{.underline}:

We have observed where the Rishi who gets enlightened through self inquiry with a true inherent desire to meet the Showman; they would come forward to share the similar experience to his few selected disciples and thus 'the Rishi' becomes 'the Guru'.  Whom have created a way for each and everyone of us (In terms of Personal God) to get us liberated and realize the Showman within ourselves. And then we learnt that people who embark a travel to meet the showman are termed as 'Brahmacharya'; To get motivated to meet the showman they start to pray the Sun who is more visible and tangible; and then continue their path for the ultimate showman.

Rishis Disciple is now in a confusion mode asking about the inner light dualities among the people and again got into confusion when he envisaged that his realization to showman has to be Sacrificed to realize him. 

We left the previous blog where Shishya shouts and asks..

" Then why do we give naivedyam ( नैवेद्यम, నైవేద్యం) to our personal god and do pooja; when Sacrificing is a tool for realizing him?"

[[***And then Rishi/Guru responds in this way***]{.underline}:]{style="color: #6aa84f;"}

" Say, you are not feeling well today; A doctor has came to your home and helped you. How do you thank him ? "

" It is simple Guruji , we give our offerings like money or related things like fruits or grains "

" Then, how do you thank to your showman, who has given you this life? "

" Guruji, are you referring that providing naivedyam is a way to thank him "

Guruji smiled and bent down near the river flow and took some water with his both hands and dranked it and continued, " Showman has provided us this water without which we cannot live; do you think that providing him the same is a way to thank him ? Like, you cannot give the medicines that doctor has given for your consumption, isn't it so ? "

" Assume that i have a skill; which you don't have at this point of time; and you have an ardent desire to gain that skill. What would you do ? "

" Since, you are my Guru. I will try to do what you like and how you think a Shishya has to be. Such that you would get impress in my behavior and provide your Vidya to me "

" Then, if you want to realize showman; and also having learnt that your realization towards Showman has to be sacrificed; what would you do ? "

With a lot of eagerness under his throat, " Guruji, we will ask the people who has already realized the showman. And behave like the ones whom showman likes us and finally we get liberated realizing him "

" If you find no one; what would you do ? "

" Guruji, I'm unable to think. This is beyond my understanding. Please tell me how is it possible !! "

Guruji smiled and said, " We need to just ask him. As he is the source "

and continued , " When someone is bound to get the answers directly from the source; that someone showers or expresses his thanks to showman in various ways i.e.; by Pooja, Praising Him and being with him; So, that is called Pooja with ardent devotion and not the pooja that you do everyday in the morning for some time; which is just a morning ritual. "

Shishya looks so fresh and completely engrossed on those thoughts; meanwhile Guruji drank stomach full of water and walks back.

Meanwhile Shishya gets awakened and comes running towards Guruji and asks " If Prayer is a ritual why it has been made as a ritual for us? "

[*Bhagvadgita: Chapter 3 ; 13th Sloka*]{.underline}

The Good People who eat what is left from the sacrifice are released from all sins but those wicked people who prepare food for their own sake - verily they eat sin.

Is some one takes it literally; we provide Naivedyam to god everyday as a Sacrifice.
