Just after reading few pages from Introductory Essay from S. RadhaKrishnan writings on "The Bhagavadgita"; felt like writing this blog piece.

Continuing from my previous blog - <https://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/learnings-indian-culture/>

There has been always a strange question in my mind why would rishis or munis has to abandon their homes and move to Himalayas. This is like living an extreme Introvert life. Anyone of you who has watched "***Into the Wild***" movie (Which is the real story of [Chris McCandless](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_McCandless))  can relate to what i was referring to.

In the previous blog we have seen the example as how we view the world and we are left with an unanswered question i.e.;  "But who is running the show? "

To know who is that showman, one has to reduces the disturbances around him that obscures him to see him. If we are at home, it becomes a transcendental concept as we will be in constant pull and pushes with the environment around us.

So, the rishis would have started a journey to find a place where they could be all alone and as well as avoid any kind of external environmental interferences; And then yureka!!!! they would had finally found their place probably the Himalayas or the Enlightenment Tree.

As a process, In that specific place they would be in a constant pursuit of that single goal through self inquiry with or without aid of guru. 

This Practice of Self Inquiry is called as "[Jnana Yoga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jnana_yoga)" { Which i have learnt while writing this blog piece}.  It is named so because; the human who is Ajnana would become Jnana only through the means of Self Inquiry.

[***P.S.***]{.underline}

*1) However, the Introvert Travel seems to have lost in its translation and led to miscomprehension and obscuring us from understanding of our own cultural Shrutis.*

*2) Chris McCandless didn't do any Self Inquiry; But he wants to live all alone and prove to the world that one can live in the wild without any external human dependency.*

*3) Rishis on the other side through Jnana Yoga has learnt the learnings of dependencies.*
