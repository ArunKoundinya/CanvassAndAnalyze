It is about 5:45 P.M.

Sanjay is shifting the gears in traffic and manoeuvring his car (like a snake) in haste. He could hardly see the traffic through his misty eyes and, in an unmindful state, pulled out the mobile from his left pocket and dialled his friend Raj.

"Raj, can you come ASAP to our regular hangout place?"

Being his thickest friend from the last year, he understood the situation, felt his necessity, and said, "Sure, Sanjay. I will reach in a couple of minutes. Will be waiting for you."

Car brushed the median strip and gained a dent in the rear door. However, Sanjay's current emotions made him pay little attention to this improvement, and without stopping anywhere else, he reached the hangout place in ten minutes.

"Raj, can you help to order a cup of fresh ginger tea for me, please"

Raj went to the stall, which is adjacent to the bakery, And in ten minutes, he came with two cups of tea and placed them on the lawn seat.

"Sanjay, what happened? Why do you look so dull? Is it about Swathi?"

Sanjay behaved as if he lived too emotionally mature and could handle things efficiently.

"Yes", said he and then sipped the hot tea and continued, " she ditched me. she said she is seeing another \*ss\*\*le".

"How can she do it to me, Raj? I have been with her for two years and have always given her enough space for her privacy. So is that the mistake I made?"

In anguish, he sipped the entire hot tea in a couple of gulps and continued, "Nevertheless, I can handle this. I will consider this moment as a blip in my personal life."

Meanwhile, Raj's phone vibrated, and slowly he picked up the phone from his right pocket and texted - "*He is with me will call you later*."

"Raj, are u seeing a girl too?"

Raj responded with a shy smile and said, "Yes."

"Be aware, Raj. Take me as an example. Never trust these girls blindly. For example, see how cruel Swathi is... First, she kissed me, and now she is ready to kiss another one..."

"Sanjay, be kind to her. She is your girlfriend".

"You are right, Raj. But it isn't any more "is". It is her choice—preferences changes as time matures. We have to respect the same. So let it go, man."

They chatted about office politics for the next half an hour and departed.

Sanjay reached the home safely and texted the same to Raj. Then, after having a good dinner with his parents, he went to his room and locked the room tightly and cried like a baby and slept off.

For the next month, he posted many motivational messages on social media and got numerous likes, ultimately leading to a boost in his self-esteem.

One fine working day, he took off from work and went to the theatre to watch a movie to ease his work pressures. Just before the interval, he spotted Raj and Swathi in upper corner seats, having their love time.

During the interval, Sanjay encountered them at the snack area, smiled, and responded, "Hey guys, hope you are having a lovely time together. Your pair is heavenly."

Swathi understood his internal sarcasm and said, "I hope you are fine with our relationship."

"Yea.Yea. Yeah... I am much stronger now. I have a huge career in front of me, which is more important than anything else."

Sanjay acted as if he got a text message and said, "Guys, you have to carry on. I have to leave for work now. I just got an emergency text." and immediately left the place with hidden frustration.

Again in the night, after his dinner, he went to his room and cried like a baby and slept off.

After thinking for a long time, he jotted down three questions, which he felt he get answers to immediately in order to reduce his worries and improve his self-esteem.

  1) Why is this always happening to me?

  2) Whom should I trust? 

  3) How much can I trust someone?

He turned to his miniature electronic device to get the answers, which re-directed him to consult a psychotherapist.

With the aid of the Practo App, he booked a top-rated psychotherapist who, in turn, practices far away from his home.

Without procrastination, he quickly drove to the place post the appointment confirmation.

After entering the consultant's room, he realised that the therapist was none other than Swathi's mother.

His brain triggered his famous question, "How Much I Can Trust Her?...."
