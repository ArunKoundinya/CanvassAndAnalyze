[*Continuing from previous blogs*]{.underline}:

We have observed where the Rishi who gets enlightened through self inquiry with a true inherent desire to meet the Showman; they would like to come forward to share the similar experience to his few selected disciples; and thus 'the Rishi' becomes 'the Guru'.  Who have created a way for each and everyone of us (In terms of Personal God) to get us liberated and realize the Showman within ourselves. And then we learnt that people who embark a travel to meet the showman are termed as 'Brahmacharya'; To get motivated to meet the showman they start to pray the Sun who is more visible and tangible; and then continue their path for the ultimate showman.

Rishis Disciple is now in a confusion mode asking about the inner light dualities among the people and again got into confusion when he envisaged that his realization to showman has to be Sacrificed to realize him. His question of "*why pooja*" made him to realize that it should not be a ritual but a method to concentrate to realize the god.

We left the previous blog where Shishya approaches to Guruji and asks , " If everyone is looking to realize the showman to achieve the state of bliss, Who will do the work Guruji and keep the world running ? "

[[***And then Rishi/Guru responds in this way***]{.underline}:]{style="color: #6aa84f;"} { *This answer will be answered through conversations in next three blogs; This is second one - conversation continued from  1) [first one](https://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning112/) 2) [second one](https://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning113/)*\] }

Guruji Says, " What is inward looking according to you? "

Shishya replies, " As per my short experience, i would like to say it is about tracing back our thought process and correcting it "

Guruji felt happy for his answer and says, " Very Good. To add on it is ideally having no thought process and seeing the things as it is "

Shishya from his unrest state moved to confusion state which is vividly visible on his facial expressions. And he enquires Guruji , " Guruji, How can we don't have a thought process "

" When you achieve that state, you are said to be in a constant connection with the showman. His thought process will become our action. The results of the actions is a reward to his thought process. So, we become his tool to convert his thoughts to action. "

As Shishya is still in confusion mode; Guruji continues, " Coming to what Inward Journey means; It is the Journey to our Showman. When you are guided by him every moment our life life becomes a blissful journey."

" If people don't get the rewarded; how would they get motivated to do their work on daily basis "  Asks Shishya with a mix of Confusion and Excitement.

" [***LokaSamgraha***]{style="color: blue"} is what you have mentioned earlier which has to be a consistent acts for generations. For such to happen we have to uncomplicate the life within us; which would only happen when we try to start an inward journey " { This is the Summary for *1) [first one](https://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning112/) 2) [second one](https://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning113/)*  }

And Guruji Continues, " If the act of [***LokaSamgraha***]{style="color: blue"} is the thought process of the showman. What more reward do we need it !!! "

Shishya who was in a state of excitement, suddenly became calm as if a bucket of cold water has been poured on his head.

After a short pause; Shishya says, " I now understand Guruji, We are just tools to our showman; as you mentioned that the world has been running on its own for millions of years; by the guidance and thought process of Showman itself. We are here to execute his thoughts to fullest extent and make the world more lively for future generations."

Guruji Smiled with Satisfaction;

" Dhanyotsmi Guruji, But how would be know that *this is the work* of HIS thoughts ? " Asks Shishya with excitement and love.
