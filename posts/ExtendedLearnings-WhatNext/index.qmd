#### [*Summary of 24 Blog Post in one go*]{.underline}: 

In this series of posts, we have observed Rishi, who gets enlightened through self-inquiry with a genuine inherent desire to meet the Showman; they would like to come forward to share a similar experience to his few selected disciples; thus, 'the Rishi' becomes 'the Guru.' These Rishis' have created a way for us (via Personal God) to get liberated and realize the Showman within ourselves.

We learned that 'Brahmacharya' are the people who embark on their travel to meet the Showman. So, to get motivated to stay on the journey to pursue Showman, they started to pray to the Sun, who is more visible and tangible; and then continue their path for the ultimate Showman.

Rishis Disciple is now in a confusion mode ( a learning soul will always be in that way). He learned about the inner light dualities among the people and envisaged that his realization of Showman must be a Sacrifice which is nothing to sacrifice that he will realize him. His question of "why pooja" made him realize that it should not be a ritual but a method to concentrate on discovering God. Also, whatever work we do, if we perform as per the direction of Showman, we will attain peace by not thinking about the reward and living out of the vicious loop of Gunas.

Now Shishya is trying to learn about the pains and their conflicts. He realized that conflict is his image of the past that differs from the present. Also, the conflict will be no more only when one tries to understand the conflict. So finally, he realizes that he must come above his conflict and understand the truth.

He started to live with the truth that God is within us and everywhere

#### [*What Next?*]{.underline}

-   One of my close friends mentioned that the content is good; why don't you post it as a book after completing your blog series. However, publishing a book requires much more rewriting and adding more details. In this base version of the book, I copy pasted the blogs for binge reading. We will revise this document together in a couple of years and make it better. ( [Link for the PDF](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IizWHZjMU_vdo-wRVyBQ_oe2puL7SKse/view?pli=1) )

-   Few of you resonate that this is good to read. But, most of us cannot relate to the current status quo. So soon, in a couple of months will start writing blogs on “ Contemporary Learnings of Indian Cultures,” which will help us in the current times. I hope you may like that too.
