[*Continuing from previous blogs*]{.underline}:

We have observed where the Rishi who gets enlightened through self inquiry with a true inherent desire to meet the Showman; they would like to come forward to share the similar experience to his few selected disciples; and thus 'the Rishi' becomes 'the Guru'.  Who have created a way for each and everyone of us (In terms of Personal God) to get us liberated and realize the Showman within ourselves. And then we learnt that people who embark a travel to meet the showman are termed as 'Brahmacharya'; To get motivated to meet the showman they start to pray the Sun who is more visible and tangible; and then continue their path for the ultimate showman.

Rishis Disciple is now in a confusion mode asking about the inner light dualities among the people and again got into confusion when he envisaged that his realization to showman has to be Sacrificed to realize him. His question of "*why pooja*" made him to realize that it should not be a ritual but a living. 

We left the previous blog where Shishya gets awakened and comes running towards Guruji and asks 

" If Prayer is a ritual why it has been made as a ritual for us?"

[[***And then Rishi/Guru responds in this way***]{.underline}:]{style="color: #6aa84f;"}

" Has anyone told you to do the ritual prayers. ( Or ) have you been compelled to do this . ( or ) have you been subject to peer pressure to do this. ( Or ) have you been volunteered to do this ? "

Shishya thinks deeply and responds, " Neither you have forced me nor my parents. It was just the norm around as everyone does it, I'm doing the same "

" Are you mentioning Guruji, that this norm has been got from random practice and it became a cult? "

Guruji responds, " If it has been some random practice, it would been cult in a small sect in a society. If it is across generations it should have been brought through deliberate attempt. Isn't is so?"

" I Assume Guruji !!!"

" Now i will ask you a question - ' Why do you think it was brought through deliberate attempt ? ' "

Shishya thinks for a minute and responds , " Is it to bring discipline ? "

" You are almost near, disciplined enforcement will not be followed when authority is not there; but a ritual practice is followed by every one albeit there isn't any authority; that is the beauty of a ritual " 

" Because, in a ritual the authority is our showman itself "

Then Shishya eagerly asks , " what is the need that this discipline has to be brought in our society ? "

" Long Ago, when there are fewer disciples. The Guru has observed that some of their well talented disciples are observing difficultly in attaining permanent connect with Showman "

" To help his disciples, that Guru has developed a methodology like praying to showman such that the talented disciples would develop more intense concentration to reach and realize the showman "

" Similarly, several other methodologies have been developed over a period of time for a specific purpose to realize showman "

Shishya asks , " Why these has become as stringent rules instead of methods ? " very intensely

Guruji responds with a smile and answers ," if the purpose has been lost over the time, the methods are protected as stringent rules; as methods face identity crisis ! "

Shishya nods his head and answers, " Yes, i now understood that if i pray for the sake of prayer; the purpose is lost; and it becomes just as a mere activity instead a purposeful ritual "

And Shishya thinks to himself and asks again , " Then why so many festivals are brought into our society, Guruji. Certainly those doesn't look like methods; It looks more like a celebration. Can you please enlighten me "
