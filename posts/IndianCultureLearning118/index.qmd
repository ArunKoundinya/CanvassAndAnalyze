[*Continuing from previous blogs*]{.underline}:

We have observed where the Rishi who gets enlightened through self inquiry with a true inherent desire to meet the Showman; they would like to come forward to share the similar experience to his few selected disciples; and thus 'the Rishi' becomes 'the Guru'.  Who have created a way for each and everyone of us (In terms of Personal God) to get us liberated and realize the Showman within ourselves. And then we learnt that people who embark a travel to meet the showman are termed as 'Brahmacharya'; To get motivated to meet the showman they start to pray the Sun who is more visible and tangible; and then continue their path for the ultimate showman.

Rishis Disciple is now in a confusion mode asking about the inner light dualities among the people and again got into confusion when he envisaged that his realization to showman has to be Sacrificed to realize him. His question of "*why pooja*" made him to realize that it should not be a ritual but a method to concentrate to realize the god. Whatever work we do, if we perform as per direction of showman we will attain peace and not thinking about the reward and living out of vicious loop of Gunas.

We left the previous blog with this question.

Shishya who is still unrest, " Then it looks like pain is inevitable as most of us cannot realize the Showman ? " asked Guruji; as his quench for knowledge is huge.

[[***And then Rishi/Guru responds in this way***]{.underline}::]{style="color: #6aa84f;"}

" How does the pain start ? "

" Whenever we get hurt deeply, Guruji "

" I do perceive the unpleasant physical sensation when we get hurt physically. Is this what you are referring to ? "

Shishya became flummoxed for a minute as he is unable to comprehend to what Guruji is referring to. However, he said " Guruji, I'm referring to the mental pain and not the physical pain "

" What does it hurt internally "

Shishya got peeved and said, " It hurts me Guruji !!! "

" I understand that. However, i do know which part gets hurt when it is physical. How do i know what gets hurt when i'm suffering from mental pain ? "

" I feel it is heart. It gets heavier when i get hurt "

" Why does the heart gets hurt ?" asks Guruji without any procrastination.

" It gets so because it got hurt. I'm sorry Guruji I don't know where this conservation is leading to ? " asked Shishya with a mixed of puzzled and annoyed facial expressions.

Guruji smiled and said, " Irony is that we don't know what it gets hurt, but we get hurt. Isn't it so interesting to know this " 

" Then what is the reason that we experience so much pain ? " 

" Our past gets into a big conflict with respect to the present or may be envisaged future. The magnitude of the conflict determines our pain. As we face many conflicts in our daily life we do face the varied range of pains and few may be worse. " Guruji paused for a second and continued,

" Also, we realize that the grey hair gets more endured to pain than younger ones because the more we face the pain the more we get endured to manage that particular conflict within ourselves "

" What is that conflict Guruji ",  asks Shishya enthusiastically now

"  As I have said earlier, the conflict is with respect to our past. In other terms we can call it as a memory or the image that we stored in our brains. We usually identify more with respect to that memory or image, so consequentially we get into a conflict zone whenever a new information or data questions the identity of that image. Thus, resulting the so called **mental** **pain** "

" I do realize this Guruji, the moment I discover that that is a reaction of my past my nerves become calmer"

" That true!!! Once we realize the cause of any pain. We cure it " said Guruji as both of them were on the way to the river banks for evening strolls.

After few moments, " How can we get out of the conflict zone!! Guruji. ",  asks Shishya restlessly.
