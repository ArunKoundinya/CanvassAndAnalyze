[*Continuing from previous blogs*]{.underline}:

We have observed where the Rishi who gets enlightened through self inquiry with a true inherent desire to meet the Showman; they would like to come forward to share the similar experience to his few selected disciples; and thus 'the Rishi' becomes 'the Guru'.Â  Who have created a way for each and everyone of us (In terms of Personal God) to get us liberated and realize the Showman within ourselves. And then we learnt that people who embark a travel to meet the showman are termed as 'Brahmacharya'; To get motivated to meet the showman they start to pray the Sun who is more visible and tangible; and then continue their path for the ultimate showman.

Rishis Disciple is now in a confusion mode asking about the inner light dualities among the people and again got into confusion when he envisaged that his realization to showman has to be Sacrificed to realize him. His question of "*why pooja*" made him to realize that it should not be a ritual but a method to concentrate to realize the god. Whatever work we do, if we perform as per direction of showman we will attain peace and not thinking about the reward and living out of vicious loop of Gunas.

Now Shishya is trying to learn about the pains and its conflicts. And has learnt that the conflict is his past image with respect to the present. Also, the conflict will be no more only when one tries to understand the conflict. Finally, leading him to realize that it is his duty to come above his own conflict and understand the truth.

We left the previous blog with this question.

" I understand that Guruji, but what work should I do by staying with the truth for life long other than staying in bliss. Of course, which is our ultimate goal. I mean after reaching the goal what should I do for the rest of my life. "

[[***And then Rishi/Guru responds in this way***]{.underline}:]{style="color: #6aa84f;"}

" What do you want to do in your life ? " asks Guruji.

Shishya closes his eyes for a few seconds and responds, " I want to stay with Showman forever. "

" If you want to stay with Showman forever, what do you have to do? "

" Guruji, I have a look inward and follow my inner light. "

" You are in the right direction, Shishya. So it is simple, isn't it so? When you find your Showman, why don't you ask him what work you have to do for the rest of your life."

Shishya looks confused, and he feels he is misguided and responds sharply,

" What is your use of being a Guru Guruji. If you are unable to guide me."

Guruji looks at Shishya and nods with a smile.

Guruji asks again, " Let me reframe it for you. Showman is the highest Guru, whom you will only meet through your inward journey. So, when you meet your highest Guru, why don't you ask him directly. Why me? "

Shishya, who still looks confused, didn't say a word.

Guruji continues, " Say, for example, if your goal is to win an Olympic medal in the running. And I helped my part by coaching you. It is a fact that it is only your sheer effort that will win you many medals. However, after a certain age, you might not be able to compete in the Olympics because of several regulatory restrictions. So what would you do?"

"Maybe I will become a coach. (or) I participate in other competitions (or) maybe pick another sport that doesn't have any restrictions."

" Perfect! "

" So, you are not stopping. You are trying to stay with your ultimate bliss through other methods or activities," responds Guruji

and continues, "The Truth remains the same. So, we must understand what we need to do to stay in that Truth forever. To not to lose our connection with the Showman."

" So, you mean to say that I would discover what I would do for the rest of my life only when I reach the showman.? " asks Shishya instantly.

" Most of us realize the Truth. But we won't stay in that Truth for longer periods. We understand what it is but seldom comprehend it. " responds Guruji with a calm and pleasant smile.

and continued, " What do you have to do if you need to comprehend the ultimate truth."

Shishya delves into his deep thinking and responds with his eyes closed, " If I understood the process that made me realize the Truth. Then I will try to hinge on that process to stay in a more extended period or forever with the Truth. The process is like preparing for running, and the goal is like winning medals. "

And Shishya continues in his heightened realization, " When resolving our internal conflict, we understand only the temporary Truth. It isn't possible to stay in that provisional Truth. But when we know the process of determining the conflict. We come above the conflict and remain with the Truth forever. Ultimately, this is the "process" that will stay with me for my journey for the rest of my life. Dhanyotsmi Guruji! "

After a while, for a change, Guruji asks, " Since you understood the process of attaining Truth. Can you describe the process ?"
