Communication has been the key for any relationship. However, most people say it is trust; but it is a derivative of communication and intimacy space shared by each other.

In every relationship there are two actors and ideally I look it as a leader & follower relationship; However, the roles would be changing depending upon the situation. Relationship is a complex space of pullings and pushing of many wants, desires, needs and impulses. Nonetheless, Communication with Clarity remains one of the most important aspect.

Here is the link from a government website where they lay importance on Communication & Relationship.

COVID-19 & Work-From-Home has placed many of the youngsters at stress because they are finding tough time to have a quality and trustful relationship with their colleagues. { Must Read Link for Millennials - [Link](https://www.explore-life.com/en/articles/communication-is-the-key#:~:text=In%20relationships%2C%20communication%20allows%20to,are%20highly%20valued%20in%20leaders.)}

There are several cases where the ego comes in between to initiate the conversation and the relationship usually remains in limbo after the quarrel or mis-understandings. Usually, most of the Millennials are finding it tough to Manage the Conflict in their relationships. I had tough time earlier and I had to let the relationship go.\

Usually Conflict plays an unavoidable part in any relationship and takes emotional toll on either of the parties. Try to fit in one of the above mentioned styles ([*in Fig2.*]{.underline}) in managing the conflict.\

Other best way to avoid the conflict is to stop creating perceptions. There are situations I have seen where we watch the intelligent TV Series on NetFlix and start judging the people in the real world. We are actually  impersonating the character from the drama into the real life; and in reality doing nothing.

To Conclude, Let us give a Chance to Ourselves to Change Thyself in improving our Interpersonal Skills.
