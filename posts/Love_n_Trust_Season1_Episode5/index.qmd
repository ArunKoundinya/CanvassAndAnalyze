He boarded the Uber, feeling unusually light.

"You look happy, sir. Big occasion?" the driver asked casually.

Sanjay smirked, "Yeah, I’m meeting my girlfriends. All three. At the same time."

"Three, sir?" The driver raised an eyebrow, trying to hide a smirk.

"Yes. Surprised? Jealous?"

"I’m not jealous. do you really believe all three love you?" asked him with curiosity. 

"Of course," Sanjay said without flinching. "Because I’ve been... honest."

"Impressive," the driver replied, trying to stay neutral ( but smiled slightly ).

Sanjay narrowed his eyes. "Don’t give me that sarcastic smile. I know what jealousy looks like."

The driver chuckled and softly recited:

> *dūreṇa hy-avaraṁ karma buddhi-yogād dhanañjaya\
> buddhau śharaṇam anvichchha kṛipaṇāḥ phala-hetavaḥ*

"Your stop has come, sir," the driver said, stopping the car.

Sanjay blinked. "What ??"

"You stop has come, sir"

"No, that verse or poem or whatever. What did you just say?"

"It’s from the Gita. When time comes i will help you understand in detail. Here, take my number… maybe on your ride back home, I’ll explain."

Sanjay scoffed. "I don’t think I’ll be going home tonight." He tossed him a ₹500 tip. "Go home. You’ve earned it."

The driver nodded silently and drove away.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sanjay walked into the restaurant and spotted Pravallika, sitting at a cozy corner table.

"Hey babe," he said, sliding into the seat with his usual charm. "You look stunning."

Pravallika looked up with soft eyes. "I love you, Sanjay. Why did it take you so long to come to me?"

Those words hit him like a dream.

"I’ve missed you," she continued. "The other day at Ohris, I waited for so long... but you didn’t come. Still, I knew you’d call again. And now, here you are."

Sanjay took her hands, "I’m sorry, Pravalli. Work pulled me away that night."

"I understand," she smiled. "And guess what—I brought gifts."

"Gifts?" he asked, raising an eyebrow.

She pointed behind him. Swathi and Pooja were walking toward them, smiling faintly.

Sanjay froze.

"I told them everything," Pravallika said gently. "They… wanted to see you too."

Swathi sat to her left. Pooja, to her right. Three women. One Sanjay.

"I love you, Sanjay," Swathi said.

"We all do," Pooja added. "You mean something real to each of us."

For a moment, Sanjay felt like the king of the world. His ego lit up.

He looked around and whispered, "I don’t know how this happened… but I love you all. Deeply. In different ways. Maybe we… don’t have to choose?"

The three looked at one another.

Pravallika smiled, "You love *all* of us?"

Sanjay nodded. "Yes. You’re each special. Why not… stay in each other’s lives? Together."

Swathi tilted her head. "So you want all of us, not one of us?"

"That’s… one way to put it," he said, with a cocky grin.

The women paused. Three glasses of cold water were thrown on his face simultaneously.

Sanjay gasped, stunned and dripping.

Swathi turned to Pravallika, "Told you he wouldn’t change."

Pooja stood up, "Thanks for tipping us off, Pravalli. If you hadn’t called us when he contacted you, he would’ve used you again."

Pravallika nodded calmly. "I had to be sure… and now, I am."

They turned and walked out—graceful, composed, and done.

Sanjay sat motionless. Anger flared inside. His face turned bright red. He clenched his fists, then suddenly smashed a glass on the table.

The waiter rushed over.

"Sir, you’ll have to pay for that."

Without a word, Sanjay settled the bill, eyes still blazing with revenge.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Outside, he remembered the driver.

He called.

"Can you come back?"

"I will be there in a minute Sir," the driver replied.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

But infact, he is already waiting outside.

The driver, sitting in the parked car, glanced at himself in the rear-view mirror. He whispered quietly:

> *na tvevāhaṁ jātu nāsaṁ na tvaṁ neme janādhipāḥ\
> na chaiva na bhaviṣhyāmaḥ sarve vayamataḥ param*

He started the engine.
