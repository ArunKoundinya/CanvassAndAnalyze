Before moving to the next series, I felt like sharing some glossaries with the audience, which makes the understanding more complete and starters can connect the dots.

I have planned for three blog posts that will get published over the next month or so. Maybe I will add more in the future.

Let us recollect the first blog of the previous series ( [Link](https://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/learnings-indian-culture/)). ( Rewriting a part of it which is required for this blog )

How do we view a movie on the Screen; Light has to fall on the movie reel which is been rotated by the wheel/motor system and in-turn that reel image is being imposed on the lens which gets enlarged and seen on the silver screen.

This is exactly how we see the world; 

-   Light is our Intelligence

-   Reel is our Thought Process or Information Available

-   Wheel is the brain that process the information or thought process

-   Lens are our senses and can be equated to Eyes

-   Screen is the world that we see

But who is running the show?

In the above explanation, we see the world from our thought process or, to simply put - "We see what we want to see." We term this as "[**MAYA**]{.underline}." It is the same "Maya" we often hear from our elders or texts, which translates to "nothing is real, but it is merely objects of our projections/perceptions."

Now let us assume that there is no reel, meaning there is no thought process or information available. Then, we just 'SEE' it. But who helps us to see? Is it not all by ourselves? If we observe newborn kids, whenever they see something new, they stare at it for some time and respond as per the environment. As we grow, our thought process comes into play, so we PROCESS & SEE. When we SEE rather than PROCESS & SEE, we remove our prejudiced beliefs and start learning, accepting, and seeing new information, thus gaining more clarity of the context. As we reduce our pre-processing unit, the internal energy/force can be diverted for our benefit; therefore, enjoying a less stressful life and attaining more clarity leads to a peaceful life.

To remove that PROCESS from our equation requires a conscious effort. At times this happens by luck or due to survival necessity. Linking back to the movie theatre example, what do we see on the screen if there is no reel? We will see the light coming from the projector, and now the showman is running the show, but no movie is playing. Then who is the showman? Showman is that guiding force within us that wants to enlighten us. So, to meet the showman, we need to make that conscious effort to remove the MAYA. The showman or this consciousness to be aware of MAYA clutches is termed "[**ATMAN**]{.underline}." Atman means nothing but our true "[***Self***]{.underline}" which wants to guide us. If we stay with Atman forever, we will be liberated and peaceful.

Then what is BRAHMAN?

I hope I have tried to explain the concept in a better way and in easy way. Please leave your feedback.
