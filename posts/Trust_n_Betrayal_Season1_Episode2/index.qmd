------------------------------------------------------------------------

It was a lazy Sunday morning, and Raj slowly woke up, reaching for his iPhone. As he scrolled through Instagram, his feed offered a mix of fun and erotica. Yet, he found himself lingering on the latter, feeding the algorithm with his choices.

> In the midst of this digital reverie, a message from Vaishara lit up his screen\
> *"Babe, I'm heading to the gym. Want to join me?"*

He glanced at the time it is 9:30 A.M.\
With a quick tap, he liked her message and replied, "I'll be there in an hour."

From the hall, Sanjay's voice broke through the morning quiet. "I hear you typing, buddy. What's the plan for today?"

Without missing a beat, Raj called back, "Let's hit the gym. Be ready in 30 minutes."

"Today? Really?" Sanjay's voice carried a note of disbelief.

Raj chuckled, shaking his head at his friend’s skepticism. "Remember, resolutions don't have to wait for New Year's. Health is wealth, my friend!"

Sanjay groaned playfully, "Alright, alright. You've convinced me. But only if we grab a good breakfast afterward."

"Deal," Raj grinned, feeling a sense of camaraderie and motivation bubble up.

As Raj prepared to meet Vaishara, a quiet determination settled in. Today wasn’t just about fitness; it was about stepping into a day filled with purpose and connection, one choice at a time.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

On their way to Gold's Gym, Raj and Sanjay made a pit stop at Vinayaka Tiffins, indulging in their favorite breakfast choices. The savory aroma of dosa and the spicy tang of chutney set a comforting start to their morning.

Once they reached the gym, they spotted Vaishara waiting by her car, a bright smile lighting up her face as Raj approached.

As Sanjay got off the bike, he noticed Vaishara and shot a teasing look at Raj, whispering, **"If you two wanted a date, why drag me along?"**

Raj chuckled, nudging Sanjay playfully. **"Bro, I might need a wingman for any surprise situations. You know how it is."**

With that, he went over to Vaishara, giving her a warm hug. Then he called back to Sanjay,"Ready to hit it, buddy?"

Sanjay grumbled under his breath, cursing Raj's audacity, but inwardly cursing himself more for feeling like the third wheel.

Inside the gym, the couple decided on a leg workout, settling into their own world of shared reps and whispered jokes. Meanwhile, Sanjay opted for an upper body routine, heading to the opposite side of the gym.

As he began his dips, his attention was caught by a strikingly beautiful girl across the room. His hormones kicked in, but he managed to keep his composure, offering her a polite, professional smile.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

She responded with a smile, a subtle invitation that Sanjay took as a green light.

With confidence, he approached her, extending a hand. *"Hi, I'm Sanjay. Trying to make these workouts a bit more interesting."*

She chuckled softly, shaking his hand. *"I'm Paavani. I guess a little company could make these weights feel lighter."*

As they exchanged pleasantries, Sanjay slipped into a gentle flirtation. *"So, Paavani, do you come here often, or did I just get lucky today?"*

She laughed, her eyes twinkling. *"I'm a regular. But maybe today was just your lucky day."*

Encouraged by her response, Sanjay continued, *"You know, I could help you with your chest workout. Spotting each other might be more fun than going solo."*

She nodded, playing along. *"I'd like that. As long as you promise not to outshine my gains."*

He grinned, *"Deal. But I can't promise not to be impressed by yours."*

Meanwhile, Vaishara had finished her workout and left, prompting Raj to wander over, curiosity piqued by Sanjay's animated expressions as he spoke to Paavani.

From a distance, Raj waved to catch Sanjay's attention, signaling it was time to wrap up.

Sanjay turned to Paavani, *"I'll be right back. Just need to check in with my friend. Don't go anywhere."*

She nodded, *"I'll be here, waiting for my spotter."*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sanjay returned to Raj with a grin, feeling the thrill of Paavani’s reciprocation. "Bro, she's totally into me. I might just get lucky today."

Raj smirked, a teasing glint in his eyes. "Mind if I have a word with her? Consider it a friendly assist."

Unaware of the ensuing twist, Sanjay nodded, feeling pleased.

Raj approached Paavani, maintaining his laid-back composure. "Hey, I'm Raj. Sanjay's friend. Mind if I join you for a bit?"

Paavani gave a welcoming nod, intrigue flickering in her eyes. Raj leaned in slightly, his voice deliberate and smooth. "You know, it’s hard not to notice a woman doesn’t just fill a room but, lights it up."

Paavani smiled, leaning into the flirtation. "You're quite the charmer, aren’t you?"

Raj chuckled, his gaze intense but kind. "Only when there's someone worth charming. Tell me, what’s a secret about you that would captivate someone like me?"

She laughed softly, matching his mood. "If I told you, it wouldn't be a secret. But you might inspire something."

The air crackled with quiet intensity. Words turned softer, hints of mischief dancing between them.

Almost without planning, Raj tilted his head and let his lips brush lightly against hers—a fleeting, tender connection. Paavani responded naturally, instinctively stepping closer for more.

But Raj gently put a finger to his lips, stepping back with a playful grin. "Sorry, beautiful. I've got a girlfriend. This was just a moment in passing."

Surprise and slight disappointment flashed in her eyes but mingled with curiosity and amusement.

Raj returned to Sanjay, feigning innocence. "See? She just kissed me. That tells you something."

Sanjay’s eyes widened, disbelieving. **"What!!! how did you even ???"**

Raj laughed, more amused than apologetic. *"I thought you were my wingman, bro. But looks like I needed to fly solo."*

Sanjay stood stunned. A wave of disbelief hit him—confused but oddly impressed by his friend’s unexpected allure.
