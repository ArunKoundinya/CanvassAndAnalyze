[*Continuing from previous blogs*]{.underline}:

We have observed where the Rishi who gets enlightened through self inquiry with a true inherent desire to meet the Showman. As  they experience the Showman; they shares the similar experience to his few selected disciples and thus 'the Rishi' becomes 'the Guru'.  Whom have created a way for each and everyone of us (In terms of Personal God) to get us liberated and realize the Showman within ourselves. And then we learnt that people who embark a travel to meet the showman are termed as 'Brahmacharya'; To get motivated to meet the showman they start to pray the Sun who is more visible and tangible; and then continue their path for the ultimate showman.

Rishis Disciple is now in a confusion mode asking about the inner light dualities among the people and then we left the previous blog post where the disciple ask the Rishi - " What should i sacrifice more? "

" I have done a lot of Sacrifice!!! What more should i do Guruji ? "

[[***And then Rishi/Guru responds in this way***]{.underline}:]{style="color: #6aa84f;"}

" What do you think is a Sacrifice? "

" Is it giving up what u like is a Sacrifice? "

" Or is it giving up what u desire for is a Sacrifice? "

" Or is it giving up your responsibilities and needs is a Sacrifice? "

" Guruji, isn't it all of them !!!! "

Guru ji Smiles and then continues ..

" If giving up is a Sacrifice? Can you give up your life for [***LokaSamgraha***]{style="color: #2b00fe;"} if that is what our showman asks for? "

Shishya gets perplexed and in confusion still asks

" If showman gives us this life; why would he asks us to take away our own life? "

Guruji continues ...

" You said above ones because most of them sacrifice or give up these things for a small time to achieve what they want and then they resume back "

" Also, Sacrifice is mis-interpreted like giving up another life ( bali ) which is completely erroneous "

" Now, as you always say, your vision as a Brahmacarya is to realize showman which is usually a larger than your life goal. Isn't it ? "

" Ideally, you have to Sacrifice something larger than your life! As Showman has give you this life after all "

Shishya gets curious and asks Guruji.. " What is that Guruji..? "

" Your most awaiting answer is that - You have to Sacrifice that you will realize showman but still pursue the path of Brahmacarya!!! Can you do this? " *{ As realizing showman is larger than his life goal }*

" Guruji, if this is the case when do i realize him and be in constant touch with him ? "

Gurji smiles and starts walking towards river and says - " Sacrifice ; you can realize him everywhere "

Shishya shouts and asks..

" Then why do we give naivedyam ( नैवेद्यम, నైవేద్యం) to our personal god and do pooja; when Sacrificing is a tool for realizing him?"
