[*Continuing from previous blogs*]{.underline}:

We have observed where the Rishi who gets enlightened through self inquiry with a true inherent desire to meet the Showman. As  they experience the Showman; they shares the similar experience to his few selected disciples and thus 'the Rishi' becomes 'the Guru'.  Whom have created a way for each and everyone of us (In terms of Personal God) to get us liberated and realize the Showman within ourselves. And then we learnt that people who embark a travel to meet the showman are termed as 'Brahmacharya'; To get motivated to meet the showman they start to pray the Sun who is more visible and tangible; and then continue their path for the ultimate showman.

***Alert***: I will write a simple Analogy for Atman & Brahman in another blog for you to relate future blog series; At this point of time let us assume that there is Showman within us and there is Showman from where we all are connected, whom we will call as universal showman.

Any Disciple would get a common doubt on their journey for Showman that

-\> If there is Ultimate Showman; Then why does our Innerlight (Our showman} directs differently for each one of us?  How does LokaSamgraha will be achieved?

[***And then Rishi/Guru responds in this way***]{.underline}:

Rishi Smiles and says, " There are many inter-related questions that you have asked. Let me try my best to guide you in the right path"

" The purpose of LokaSamgraha comes when we all think; that there is something called as ***LokaSamgraha***! "

" Consequently, You have to realize that "*You*" is also part of Everyone "

" After you get acquaintance of this topic, before everybody; you have to start working for the same "

Rishi pauses and then continues;

" As I'm seeing your face, your core question looks unanswered i.e.; how does everyone has different paths? "

" It is just the nature of our environment i.e.; each life on this planet is not the same. However, every life is interdependent on each-other for its survival and harmony. "

" Coming to your point, the good thing about the showman is that whatever we seek and ask him you get his help and the answer. The Core lies on how do you ask him "

" If you ask yourself superficially, your thoughts will respond;"

" If you ask yourself deeply, your subconscious will respond;"

" If you ask yourself more deeply; there he is your showman; waiting for your arrival;"

" We usually get carried away by our thoughts and subconscious {which mostly has recency effect} than by hands of our showman that is the reason the paths are different. However, not to mistake or undermine those thoughts are also the products of showman little earlier of our life. ( *if they were self exploratory questions as mentioned above* ) "

" Knowingly or Unknowingly we are all guided by our showman. But to be in constant touch with our Showman. We have to be aware and achieve the state of calmness and steadiness to reach him. "

" Gurji, How does i achieve that state of steadiness ? "

" You have to do Sacrifice !!! "

" I have done a lot of Sacrifice!!! What more should i do Guruji ? "
