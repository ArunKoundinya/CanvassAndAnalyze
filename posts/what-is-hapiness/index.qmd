It's been long time I have penned my opine. This time, I chose a topic that's been greatly researched; and been perceived as a "state".

In this article i tried to showcase about my understanding on Happiness (but certainly not talking about Happiness Index- which is damn debatable).

It was 3rd Feb of Year 2014 \@ 10:30 A.M. I was at Vemulavada ([Sri Raja Rajeshwara Temple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Raja_Rajeshwara_temple)) along with my larger family. As we are walking on our way to our lodges (after our Dharshan), few of them de-routed to another lane to buy some gifts and other apparels, abandoning my father and me.

"Dad, what's in the breakfast", I asked my father as if it is the next thing on my activity list.

"Arun, let them come. How are you feeling about your recent endeavour of getting admission to ISB."

"I'm feeling happy, Dad".

"Are you trying to say that getting admitted into ISB is making you happy. Are you trying to correlate the happiness with respect to external environment?" 

"I could not get you"

He said so many philosophical things at that time. But none couldn't get into my brain. I felt he sensed the same and finally he took his index finger and placed on centre of my forehead and said "***Happiness lies here***". I couldn't get the sense to what my father was saying as I felt that I'm intelligent enough to understand about Happiness from "[***Google***]{.underline}" in a simpler way.  After an year I only realised that "[*Happiness*]{.underline}" is still a fuzzy concept in Philosophy and Psychology. 

Lately on 1st of Week of Feb 2018; out of blue, when I was browsing youtube, I found this lovely collated video of Sadguru by Dorothy.

Vide Summaries about "[*5 Things that Happy People do differently*]{.underline}".

1.  Live in Present

2.  Don't take yourself too seriously

3.  Take responsibility for your inner state

4.  Manage yourself not others

5.  Realise that your not immortal

Only after 4 years I realised what is meant by "***Happiness lies here***". i.e.; Happiness lies within you. 

I will try to explain in simpler way;

God has given us many vital organs namely such as brain, eyes, mouth, teeth and several others. If we  take care of them wisely and make use of them optimally/fullest we will be in a state of happiness.

For example, most happy people are found to be best programmers, best artists and best authors who use their most wisest organs to be fullest. They use it to the fullest because they are not best but because they have a sense of satisfaction once they use their organs to the fullest, which makes them to be happy.

1.  Using our Organs at optimal/fullest - Makes us feel Satisfied.

2.  Realisation of Satisfaction - Makes us feel happy.

3.  Continuous loop of Point 1 & 2 - A Celebration.

We don't need an occasion for a Celebration. All we need ourselves to Celebrate each and every moment of our life.

A positive mind reflects positivity; A Smile Engenders Smiles; A celebrating soul lives a life;
