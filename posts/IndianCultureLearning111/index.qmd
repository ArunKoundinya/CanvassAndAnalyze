[*Continuing from previous blogs*]{.underline}:

We have observed where the Rishi who gets enlightened through self inquiry with a true inherent desire to meet the Showman; they would like to come forward to share the similar experience to his few selected disciples; and thus 'the Rishi' becomes 'the Guru'.  Who have created a way for each and everyone of us (In terms of Personal God) to get us liberated and realize the Showman within ourselves. And then we learnt that people who embark a travel to meet the showman are termed as 'Brahmacharya'; To get motivated to meet the showman they start to pray the Sun who is more visible and tangible; and then continue their path for the ultimate showman.

Rishis Disciple is now in a confusion mode asking about the inner light dualities among the people and again got into confusion when he envisaged that his realization to showman has to be Sacrificed to realize him. His question of "*why pooja*" made him to realize that it should not be a ritual but a method to concentrate to realize the god.

We left the previous blog where Shishya nods his head and answers, " Yes, i now understood that if i pray for the sake of prayer; the purpose is lost; and it becomes just as a mere activity instead a purposeful ritual " And Shishya thinks to himself and asks again , " Then why so many festivals are brought into our society, Guruji. Certainly those doesn't look like methods; It looks more like a celebration. Can you please enlighten me "

[[***And then Rishi/Guru responds in this way***]{.underline}:]{style="color: #6aa84f;"}

" Have you seen those fishes swim by in that river pond ? "

" Many times Guruji !!! "

" Luckily we didn't see them celebrating festivals right ? "

Shishya with an argumentative facial expression said, " they either don't pray as well ! "

Guruji smiled as said, " May be they don't pray like us "

" In the same way, they might not be celebrating festivals like us. This can also be true Guruji "

" Very true. How do they celebrate then ? "

Shishya went from argumentative facial expression to thinking facial expression and said, " Guruji, as i have mentioned, i didn't see the way they celebrate like us. But i have seen them playing and at times in beautiful patterns"

" It is very lovely to see them playing. Do you see any time pattern in their play."

" I feel they play when ever they like to; Am i right Guruji "

" Yes, luckily fishes don't behave like adult humans; they are not given instructions for playing. Fishes love to have fun and play is one such method for them to be in fun mode. When we are kids we have a lots of fun by ourselves, but when we start growing older we search for fun in our life. "

" Guruji, are you saying festivals are like instructions for us to play together "

Guruji sat down under the tree shade and asked his Shishya to sit down and said , "  Hope you agree that everyone of us would like to realize the god. However, most of them due to their work ( karma ) might not be in a position to be continuously in touch with our showman, although there is a way "

Shishya is eagerly listening and has said nothing

Guruji continued, " Long Ago, a highly intellectual Guruji and his disciples has seen that many of us are in a rat race of life and are in trouble to find enough fun for years. So, they almost created a festival( as a norm) a month as a reason for being fun. To sustain that fun for future generations and ages, they tied up with rituals which were headed by our showman itself "

" This is one example of ***LokaSamgraha*** which you were trying to discuss with me a while earlier "  

Shishya kept his head down and got completely engrossed in his own train of thoughts

Guruji continued with a smile on his face, " If we are still trying to have fun. When can we be in a state of bliss !!! "

Shishya slowly moved his head upwards with his forehead muscles relaxed and said, " Dhanyotsmi Gurji!!! "

After few ***ghatikas*** , Shishya approached again to Guruji and asked , " If everyone is looking to realize the showman to achieve the state of bliss, Who will do the work Guruji and keep the world running ? "
