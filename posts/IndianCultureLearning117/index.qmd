[*Continuing from previous blogs*]{.underline}:

We have observed where the Rishi who gets enlightened through self inquiry with a true inherent desire to meet the Showman; they would like to come forward to share the similar experience to his few selected disciples; and thus 'the Rishi' becomes 'the Guru'.  Who have created a way for each and everyone of us (In terms of Personal God) to get us liberated and realize the Showman within ourselves. And then we learnt that people who embark a travel to meet the showman are termed as 'Brahmacharya'; To get motivated to meet the showman they start to pray the Sun who is more visible and tangible; and then continue their path for the ultimate showman.

Rishis Disciple is now in a confusion mode asking about the inner light dualities among the people and again got into confusion when he envisaged that his realization to showman has to be Sacrificed to realize him. His question of "*why pooja*" made him to realize that it should not be a ritual but a method to concentrate to realize the god. Whatever work we do, if we perform as per direction of showman we will attain peace and not thinking about the reward and living out of vicious loop of Gunas.

We left the previous blog with this question.

Whilst in midst of his nap shishya woke up suddenly and ran to his master and asked, " What happens in the due course if our actions hurt others ? " 

[[***And then Rishi/Guru responds in this way***]{.underline}::]{style="color: #6aa84f;"}

" What is the point of reference when you say, "*our actions hurt others* " "

" As I look at it, reference point doesn't make sense here. Each and everyone of us gets hurt by actions of each other. " Shishya replied haughtily.

Yet again, Guruji asked the same questions in an equable manner, " What is the point of reference when you say, "*our actions hurt others* " "

Shishya continued in the same manner and this time changed his answer in haste and said, " Okie. Let us assume it is from my point of reference? "

" Are you saying that you are getting hurt, because someone either intentionally or unintentionally is hurting you ? " 

" Yup. This is what I'm trying to convey to you " said shishya.

Guruji smiled and replied, " So, their actions tend to hurt you. Am I right in my understanding. "

" Yes. However, not all actions. At times. "

" At times, their actions either intentionally or unintentionally is hurting you. Am I near in framing the right problem statement ? ", Guruji responded with Smile.

Shishya said, " Yes ", with confusion at heart.

" In your point of reference, those actions are not acceptable and thus it is hurting you. What happens if your point of reference for those actions are wrong ? "

Shishya reacted by saying, " It is a possibility. "

Guruji said, " So, you are saying that your happiness is married on someone actions rather than with the realization of Showman ? "

Shishya calmed his senses and asked, " I understood where this is leading to. What if we change the point of reference i.e.; if my actions are hurting others ? "

Guruji said, " If you are asking this question. I'm assuming that you are in a profession that hurts others like say in war/parenting etc.;. On the other side, if you are hurting someone passionately and acting modestly with the same person is a hypocritical living. "

Shishya nodded his head as a signal to continue.

" Conflict arise in our mind, when our thinking reference dilly-dallying in our mind. Intent and identity of our action changes when the reference changes to our Supreme Showman."

" As we were discussing a while earlier ( previous blogs ), identity realization liberates us."

Shishya who is still unrest, " Then it looks like pain is inevitable as most of us cannot realize the Showman ? " asked Guruji; as his quench for knowledge is huge.

This particular blog has been a learning lesson for me. Hope you might provide some valuable suggestions and improvements; if any.
