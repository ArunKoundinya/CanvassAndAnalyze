If you have heard about 99Club. This article is about possibility of shifting from 99Club to 100Club.

"Dad!!! Good Morning. Yesterday I came across the term - '99Club'. I feel there is something awry about the concept. Have you felt it so?"

His dad got confused and asked - " I always felt awry from the time when you started thinking and questioning me. This awry ofcourse should be new for me. Please continue son."

Vikram smiled for his Dads Sarcasm and continued, "Let me cut down the crap and get straight to the point".

"Of course you should. Your dad is not yet retired."

"Dad!!!!", said Vikram, by nodded his head side ways with a smile; and continued, " The concept of 99Club seems to be about being happy with what we have. If we are happy with what we have then we become complacent and tend to be comfort zone. Right.  And this may lead to zero goal life.?"

"Hope you are not saying me to that - '*Dad; don't get retire and become complacent.*'. such that your eternal pocket money flow will be assumed forever."

"Dad!!! Please."

"Vikram, I'm trying to protect myself for any kind of shock that you might give it to me. However, your body language and expression communicating to me that you are indeed looking for some parental guidance after a long time. Great.", saying this he set aside the file plank and got up from his chair and sat beside his son and continued, "Vikram, we had the same discussion long time ago. Happiness and goal are not related."\
\
"I understand that dad. Like for example, Apple would not have become a large company if they become complacent. But 99Club concept says that - be happy with what you have"\
\
"Very Good. Did it became large company in a year?"\
\
"No. It took them long. Which is what I'm trying to say"\
\
"How many goals did Apple achieved"\
\
"If you mean in terms of products. It is iTune, Mac, iPhone, iPod etc.; so far as i can recollect"\
\
"Lovely. If we get back to the story of 99Club. Do u think iTune, Mac, iPod are individual coins which Apple is trying to collect to make it to 100?"\
\
"Nope Dad. Each is an individual project with different timelines. Success of each project pushed them to go for an extra mile each time"\
\
"How did they enjoy their each of their success"\
\
"They celebrated and shared their happiness with shareholders and stakeholders"\
\
"Great Vikram; You have contradicted your own assumption earlier. Isn't it so. As you said, Apple is indeed was happy for their success and what they possess. However, they never got deviated from their larger goal of improving the customer experience through best use of technology." He said and took and sip of water and then continued, " The premise of 99Club is more about the humans relentless desire of non-completeness."\
\
Vikram, absorbed what is being told and thought for a while and said, "What Makes it Complete?"\
\
"That is a great question. We cannot bring in the Company discussion in this question as company by itself cannot make it complete. As it runs on Goals, Vision, Mission and finally by numbers. On the other side, humans are run by emotions most of the times."\
\
"Of Course. Humans are emotional beings"\
\
"What do you think makes my day Vikram."\
\
Without any delay Vikram replied, " As I know you, You feel happy whenever you spent some quality time with mom or me."\
\
"Why do you think it makes me complete?"\
\
"Is it because you like them most?" Vikram questioned his father and nodded his head with a smile.\
\
"It is usually the other way round. It is because you both like being around with me." said his father, " In generally, if we share our positive emotions or moments with loved ones. It makes our day and make it complete. :) "\
\
"This is lovely. But however, I'm unable to relate this to control of relentless desires of human."\
\
"Vikram. Human runs each and every day such that he and his future family is in a better off position."\
\
"Agree"\
\
"However, there are some immediate dependants and some other indirect dependants; And all these dependants love to spend time with us. All we have to acknowledge them and give them some time, love and positive moments and emotions."\
"Most of the times, all these interactions and moments make us realise that our dependants are happy with the existing status quo as well. Which shifts our gear from getting bigger in terms of desire to reaching to our goal."\
\
"This is lovely to hear Dad. Love and belongingness plays a major role in our life"\
\
"Yes. it is more lovely because it gets strengthened when we reciprocate in a right way."\
\
Vikram got up and smiled and said to his father, "Dad!!! I got the message. I think i need to find girlfriend to make me complete."\
\
"Good for you. All the best."

I would like to conclude this blog by saying HAVE A SWEET TIME WITH OUR SWEET HEARTS TO MAKE OUR LIFE SWEEEET  :)
