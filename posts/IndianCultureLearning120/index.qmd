[*Continuing from previous blogs*]{.underline}:

We have observed where the Rishi who gets enlightened through self inquiry with a true inherent desire to meet the Showman; they would like to come forward to share the similar experience to his few selected disciples; and thus 'the Rishi' becomes 'the Guru'.  Who have created a way for each and everyone of us (In terms of Personal God) to get us liberated and realize the Showman within ourselves. And then we learnt that people who embark a travel to meet the showman are termed as 'Brahmacharya'; To get motivated to meet the showman they start to pray the Sun who is more visible and tangible; and then continue their path for the ultimate showman.

Rishis Disciple is now in a confusion mode asking about the inner light dualities among the people and again got into confusion when he envisaged that his realization to showman has to be Sacrificed to realize him. His question of "*why pooja*" made him to realize that it should not be a ritual but a method to concentrate to realize the god. Whatever work we do, if we perform as per direction of showman we will attain peace and not thinking about the reward and living out of vicious loop of Gunas.

Now Shishya is trying to learn about the pains and its conflicts. And has learnt that the conflict is his past image with respect to the present.

We left the previous blog with this question.

Shishya looks as if his quench for knowledge is done. However, within a moment with his unrest expression, " It looks good on paper, would that be possible or is it a practical solution? "

[[***And then Rishi/Guru responds in this way***]{.underline}:]{style="color: #6aa84f;"}

" What makes you putative about our discussion? " asks Guruji.

" It is like filling up the pond with river water. However, the river is 50 km away from the pond; and we have to fill using our cupped hands !! Vision is good, but it looks highly impossible that I doubt to pour even a drop in our lifetime. "

" Superb! Then what did you realize from our discussions? " asks Guruji with his usual serene smile.

" I have just realized that; it is not practical to follow your suggestions! " says Shishya with a lot of intensity

" Superb!  Let me help you here. In our discussion so far, what is the fact, and what is the opinion? "

Shishya closed his eyes and responded,  " Fact is the realization that we get influenced/biased from our past. The opinion is one that where you have referred that we need to start from a fresh slate of mind in every moment of our life. "

" So, you are deferring the opinion but not the fact. Am I right? "

" Yes. That is the reason I have said it is not practical! " 

" Good. If you agree that the fact is truth will that not help you? "

" I need a solution !! " responds Shishya with exacting intensity

Guruji smiles and responds, " I will give you the solution that has worked for me. And you are saying that is not practical. So, I will be anachronistic as per your comprehension "

" But I need a solution Guruji ! " responds Shishya

" Let me tell you one more fact, in a hurry to look for a solution we do not internalize the fact. So, our realization will be in words but not inside our minds. So ideally, there might be several solutions available for our problems but none seems working for us. Consequentially, we either live with the fact or defer the fact. "

" I can connect to this. But why does others' solution doesn't seem to be a right fit for us? "

" Likewise there are several methods to realize god *{[refer earlier blog](https://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning110/)}* there are several solutions to a problem. If we concentrate on methods we can never reach the end goal of ours but we might be reaching or working for someone else's; which is of course not the solution we are looking for. "  responds Guruji

" How can I find my solution? Your solution is very impractical and others' solutions would be like a patch fix for that conflict. "

" Wonderful Shishya!  I would recommend that instead of finding the solution; try to learn more about your conflict and understand its roots." answers Guruji to incite interest in Shishya.

Shishya started to ponder to what Guruji said and in few minutes he asks, " If I just live around these conflicts and try to understand them, when can I reach an ultimate bliss situation and realize the showman. I doubt is there a showman in reality ? "
