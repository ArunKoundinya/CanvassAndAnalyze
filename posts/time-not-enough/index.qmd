Time & Tide waits for none. We value our time to such an extent that we are so particular how 24 hours of a day has to be managed. And yet how many times have we felt that a Sunday has gone like a flash. I bet most of us would experience it on every Sunday. And on that very Sunday we stack up so many [*ToDo*]{.underline} list; only to say in the evening to ourselves that "There isn't enough time!!!".

Let us assume in a arbitrary world we had given excess time i.e.; 1 Full Day = 72 Hours. And we have obtained this bonus for 1 complete year. On comparing to real world we now have two bonus years at our perusal. Can we assume that we don't say to ourselves that "There isn't enough time!!!". To our irony, if we do a random survey we would comfortably conclude that there is no significant difference observed with respect to the extra time obtained. Does that mean are we not valuing time???

This usually occurs since we do the same things everyday for most part of our time; say for example eating, sleeping, driving and few others. As most of these activities cannot be automated and we feel that other activities have to be done quicker to squeeze time for other future works.\
\
This situation can be called as a [***Time Trap***]{.underline} as we always experience that Future Time is less than that of Present Time.

In haste, I request not to open an another browser tab and google for "How to manage the time effectively". You will get a blanket solutions that might not even address the solution for an average human being as these solutions aren't focused on understanding the problem but provides just an alternative solution in a better presentable way that we already know. Also do remember that time cannot be managed because the time waits for none.\
\
So fundamental question would be, what goes in our brain that makes [***TimeTrap***]{.underline} to be a vicious circle that can't be evaded.\
\
Again i request not to conduct RCTs and show our extra eagerness to find some interaction variables. On the contrary, it all needs introspection.\

How many times: { Usually the 80% of Time Traps }\

-   In our childhood, we would be reading the same chapter {usually the 1st chapter} till our term ends.
-   We would have paid fees for different fitness clubs only to perform workout for few months.
-   We would have read the same novel for over an year as we found half of it is boring.
-   We would have taken same resolutions every new year.
-   and so on...

This doesn't mean that we are not valuing time. We are valuing so much that we have took extra care for these decisions. However, we don't finish the activity completely { or don't do it in full attention}. This is because we are managing the time and trying to squeeze this new activity to take up the other activity. To only make a half cooked activity only to revisit for the next time.

To keep the activity in-tact, I feel that the term "milestone" seems to be introduced such that we are motivated about the progress and have a sense of achievement at the end of each mile-stone. This habit usually evades our time killing habit i.e.; revisiting the particular milestone even after its completion as we are progressing for completing the balance milestones for that activity.

To conclude, the old age "that a work begin is half done" is still true as it motivates for us to begin a new activity at each period of our life time. However, [it is our responsibility to finish it in right way to our fullest ability till its milestones are finished completely]{.underline}.
