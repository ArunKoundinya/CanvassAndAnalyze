[*Continuing from previous blogs*]{.underline}:

We have observed where the Rishi who gets enlightened through self inquiry with a true inherent desire to meet the Showman; they would like to come forward to share the similar experience to his few selected disciples; and thus 'the Rishi' becomes 'the Guru'.  Who have created a way for each and everyone of us (In terms of Personal God) to get us liberated and realize the Showman within ourselves. And then we learnt that people who embark a travel to meet the showman are termed as 'Brahmacharya'; To get motivated to meet the showman they start to pray the Sun who is more visible and tangible; and then continue their path for the ultimate showman.

Rishis Disciple is now in a confusion mode asking about the inner light dualities among the people and again got into confusion when he envisaged that his realization to showman has to be Sacrificed to realize him. His question of "*why pooja*" made him to realize that it should not be a ritual but a method to concentrate to realize the god. Whatever work we do, if we perform as per direction of showman we will attain peace and not thinking about the reward and living out of vicious loop of Gunas.

Now Shishya is trying to learn about the pains and its conflicts. And has learnt that the conflict is his past image with respect to the present. Also, the conflict will be no more only when one tries to understand the conflict. Finally, leading him to realize that it is his duty to come above his own conflict and understand the truth. Further, trying to learn the process of being with the truth for-ever.

We left the previous blog with this question.

After a while, for a change, Guruji asks, " Since you understood the process of attaining Truth. Can you describe the process ?"

[[***And then Rishi/Guru & Shishya Dicusses in this way***]{.underline}:]{style="color: #6aa84f;"}

"  Guruji, you have mentioned that the methods have to be different to attain truth. So one has to discover their methods."

" Aren't methods and process is same? "

" How can it be Guruji? You have mentioned earlier that ([link](https://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning110/)) methods are tools to realize showman. But they became mere rituals ", answered Shishya with a calmer voice.

" Methods got turned into rituals such that the process stays longer, but the process has lost its soul in due course"

Shishya looks deeper into his thought process by closing his eyes and nods his head.

"  Guruji, these methods, of course, are created to realize the showman with-in, i.e., Atman. "

Guruji nodded his head happily and said, " Elaborate."

" When you pray to a personal god, it means you are trying to speak to your showman. So also, when we do '*Abhishekam*' with milk or water, we try to cleanse the soul and get closer to our showman. So to infer, every method is devised as a relentless effort to realize the showman with-in."

Guruji felt satisfied by his responses and said, " Then what is the process? "

" Guruji, there is no process. We created the rules, but the actual process is to be with the showman in any activity we perform. "

Guruji hinted to Shishya, " In any activity that we perform? Right now, we are talking. Can this be as well ? "

Shishya smiled and responded, " Speaking to others and not to be confused with responding to others is an activity. In which we speak to a reflection of our showman with others. And whatever they speak is the real Naivedyam ( [link](https://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning109/) ) to our showman itself."

And Shishya continued with an enlightenment aura, " Actually, all living beings and this entire universe are the reflections of our supreme showman. We are just a tiny part of the supreme showman. Understanding this Oneness of showman among all of us is the actual process of staying with showman forever."

Guruji opened his eyes happily and said, " Shabhash Shishya, now you are a truly enlightened person. You don't need any other Guru. You are Guru by yourself". Saying this, Guruji packed his bag and left the ashram on a happy note.
