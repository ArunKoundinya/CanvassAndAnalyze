Any Normal person assumes as in following way for these phrases:

1.  Hard-work: A Consistent Effort.
2.  Achievement: Special Effort.
3.  Success: Accomplishment.

Let me run through a conversation between a father and son. Where the son discovers the interlink between these three phrases and which finally makes him to discover the root for these branches.

***About the Roles***:

[*Son*]{.underline} - Let us call him as Arjun for this Blog. He runs a small start-up company let's say a manufacturing company.

[*Father*]{.underline} - He is a retired Government Employee. 

***Conversation***:

Father: "*Arjun, How are you doing these days.*"

Arjun is too busy in his thinking and unconsciously eating a piece of idly with the fork. It took him half a minute to recognise his fathers voice and then responded in a non-emotive way, "*Yeah Dad, I'm doing great. I'm enjoying the morning idly made by mother. It is delicious.*"

As Mother can understand her child hunger, Father can visualize the internal uneasiness of his child. He continued to observe his sons way of unconscious eating till both of them are done with their breakfast.\
\
As it was a Sunday, immediately after the breakfast Arjun climbed the stairs and went straight to his room and locked the door.\
\
After about a half an hour, sharp multiple trashing sounds are heard from Arjuns' room. Father immediately shouted "*Arjun, Is all well?*". "*Yeah Papa, It is just my mobile.*". However, Arjuns' father is not convinced by the answer; and he responded by knocking the door and said "*Beta, Open the door.*"\
\
Arjun hesitantly opened the door and said "*Nothing major happened Papa. I need just a little time.*"\
Father came inside the room without any response and occupied the laptop chair with comfort and signaled his child to sit beside him on the bean bag.\
\
Arjun locked the door from inside and understood that there would be some discussion with his father so with hesitation sat on the bean bag. His father took his sons' right hand in his hands and said, "*I know you need time. And everyone do need time in need. But only few recognize that they need help. And yet only few would be able to step forward for that little guidance from others. And as you are my only child, it is my utmost love and care on you that i took it as my privilege to ask you - How can i help you my friend.*"\
\
Arjun with water filled eyes hugged his father immediately and said in a low voice, "*I'm loosing the game in all directions. I know this is temporary. But I feel it is heavy; I feel frustrated and dejected and all thoughts are obscured also it seems to me that there is no way ahead.*"\
\
He tapped thrice on his sons back slowly and made him to sit straight on his bean bag and said, "*Every one feels in the same way when multiple problems comes at a time. However, most of us forget to ask the most important question - What are we loosing. And what are you loosing my child now."*\
*\
*"*Dad, I'm suffering from high lower level employee attrition. Which is making the project delivery timeliness to stretch and in-turn pushing me to pay for heavy penalties and finally making my profits to shrink. Again, this is putting me under tight pressure to hire the best resource for the job and cycle is getting revolved.*"\
\
His father smiled and said, "*I'm asking what are you loosing and not what your company is facing.*"\
\
Arjun puzzled for a second and said, "*If my company is facing problems. Doesn't it mean that I'm loosing the game?*"\
\
"*I think you didn't get me. Let me put the question in an another way. What game are you playing?*"\
\
Arjun smiled sarcastically and said, "*Dad, I think you didn't get me too. If a company has to run continuously it has be at-least self sustainable. The game I'm playing is make my company sustainable for ever and meet its larger vision & mission.*"\
\
"*Great!!! Let us keep aside your recent year failures and see your past 10 years consecutive wins in your game. Shall we?*"\
\
"*Yeah Papa...."* said Arjun by slowly taking a sip of water.\
\
"*Good! Why do you think you had a success in last 10 years after the company inception."*\
*\
*"*My Targets are comparatively very low than now and we have achieved it successfully by of-course persistent hard-work by the entire team; as we need to prove ourselves in the market that we are the 'best solution providers'.*"\
"*Also, we break the larger milestone into smaller milestones which we ensured to achieve such that it provides us a large imputes for barge ahead to bring success for our newbie company.*"\
"*Also, the said methodologies haven't changed but I'm loosing the game now.*"\
\
His father smiled happily and said, "*It is great that you have spoken on Hard-work, Achievement and Success. You said that by doing hard-work you achieved success and by doing persistent hard-work you achieved multiple achievements that made you to enjoy success for last 10 years. Can I know why did you do hard-work? And what happened when you achieved and how did you feel every time you succeeded?*"\
\
Arjun responded with a quick smile, "*Dad, any one does hard-work to achieve his immediate target. And of course persistent hard-work to achieve his goal which is known to every one. Personally, i can say that when we achieved small milestones it can give us confidence that we can achieve our clients aspirations. Every time me met our client expectations or aspirations we felt proud and happy that our company would become a best solution provider for the companies.*"\
\
Arjun's father made his back bone straight for a minute to assimilate his thinking and replied, "*So, are you saying that you are working to see the happy faces of your clients?*"\
\
"*Of course. '[Customer is King]{.underline}'. If we leave him happy any business would survive.*" Swiftly replied Arjun with pride.\
\
His father gave a mockery smile at his answer and said,"*So you and your team is surviving by seeing your clients happiness than fulfilling the needs of your clients.*"\
\
"*I didn't get you Papa.*"\
\
"*Let me explain in a simple way. As a father if I had worried for your happiness I would have not met all your fundamental needs. As per my capacity I created a balance for your needs and happiness. Finally, I was elated when you took a decision of funding your own start-up which I call it as my success.*"\
"*When I understood the journey for my success, I was always happy and enjoyed each and every step that I took. I seldom cared for the result but never worried because, as I felt that one day there will be a success.*"\
His father took a deep breath and took a sip of water and then continued in a low yet with profound voice.\
"*As per my understanding you have defined the company success in yearly goals which might not be a healthy parameter for all the stake holders for being happy in each and every work they do. You might need to create a strong purpose for long term happiness for the company.*"\
"*I know this is easy to say and tough to practice. But I strongly believe in your competence.*"\
\
Arjun showed an enlightened face and said, "*I understood Dad. So far i was searching the happiness by seeing the final result. And I rarely enjoyed the work that I do; which is the fundamental reason for my frustration.*"\
"*Also,* *problems will be there in every journey that we take. If my mood isn't happy to recognise and understand the problems; I would never have the courage to go ahead to solve them rather would be afraid of them.*"\
"*Thanks a lot Papa for your guidance as usual. I will take help of my core team to rebuild the solution by laying down the larger case study.*"\
\
"*You are always welcome, Arjun. Remember I'm always with you!!!*"
