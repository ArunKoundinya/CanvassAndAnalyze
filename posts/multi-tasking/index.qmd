One and half year ago I came across these two books which helped me to improve and change my thinking on multi-tasking.

The first question that came to me at that time is to *Why i have to do multi-tasking*? The usual meaning of Multi-Tasking is performance of multiple tasks at one time.

May I'm inclined to do multiple tasks in the following scenarios: 1) When-ever there is dearth of time and deadlines squeeze in. 2) If I'm good at one thing. 3) At times for no reason I like to multi tasking. As it gives a kick at the end of achievement. 4) When-ever I'm having food.

If we google down with right phrase questions we will get the right answers.\

Let me paste my answers here:\
***For Question-1***: The answer is about time management

***For Question-2***: In Generally it is a myth to assume we are good at one thing and do two activities at same time { Ideally we cannot do two activities at the same. We switch the activities }. So, perform the activities when you think the activity which is been undergoing does not require cognitive attention.

***For Question-3***: Aaah. This is called so called fashion word - Instant Gratification. And may be this cult. But does that make worse or happy or some thing. See a quick video from Ellen.

***For Question-4***: I tend to watch TV or browse something else while eating food. Because I always assumed that having food is the least cognitive function involved. Do you think as well like me and here is the answer.

[***Then what is depth & breadth of Multi Tasking***]{.underline}: It comes from Focussed thinking and diffuse thinking. Watch this video

We may argue by saying that [***Diffuse Thinking is same as Multi Tasking***]{.underline}?? Categorically Diffuse thinking and Multi Tasking are complete different. While Multi Tasking is doing multi things. Diffuse Thinking is create a thought process by connecting various things to get a larger picture. That's the reasons most of the inventions didn't happen in the lab area in earlier times it happened else where { i.e.; while driving, bathing , exercising etc.; }.

[***To Conclude***]{.underline}: Watch this video which is a better conclusion than what i thought to write.
