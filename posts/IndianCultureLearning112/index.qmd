[*Continuing from previous blogs*]{.underline}:

We have observed where the Rishi who gets enlightened through self inquiry with a true inherent desire to meet the Showman; they would like to come forward to share the similar experience to his few selected disciples; and thus 'the Rishi' becomes 'the Guru'.  Who have created a way for each and everyone of us (In terms of Personal God) to get us liberated and realize the Showman within ourselves. And then we learnt that people who embark a travel to meet the showman are termed as 'Brahmacharya'; To get motivated to meet the showman they start to pray the Sun who is more visible and tangible; and then continue their path for the ultimate showman.

Rishis Disciple is now in a confusion mode asking about the inner light dualities among the people and again got into confusion when he envisaged that his realization to showman has to be Sacrificed to realize him. His question of "*why pooja*" made him to realize that it should not be a ritual but a method to concentrate to realize the god.

We left the previous blog where Shishya approaches to Guruji and asks , " If everyone is looking to realize the showman to achieve the state of bliss, Who will do the work Guruji and keep the world running ? "

[[***And then Rishi/Guru responds in this way***]{.underline}:]{style="color: #6aa84f;"} { [*This answer will be answered through conversations in next three blogs*]{style="font-size: x-small;"} }

" Who is running the world ? "

" Guruji, I mean we as humans are responsible for keeping the world intact and save it for future generations "

Guruji Smiled and said, " World has been running on its own for millions of years. And our Age is minuscule to what the world has seen so far "

" Guruji, I mean that we made the living more structured and ease of living is continuously being made convenient for generations ahead. This is also a consistent act of [***LokaSamgraha***]{style="color: blue"} as i look at it "

Guruji again smiled and said, " You are very near; but your definitions and its comprehension of the terms made it amiss "

Relaxed Shishya suddenly becomes strained and blankly stares at Guruji

" What happened you looked worried ! "

" I'm good Guruji. When you said my definitions are wrong; i was little worried on my thought process "

" Every human thought process evolves over time till it achieves the state of being in permanent connection with our showman. Till then we can always improve our thought process and its comprehensions "

" Thanks a lot Guruji, can you elaborate as where have i missed "

" [***LokaSamgraha***]{style="color: blue"} as it means it is for people welfare i.e.; for all sects of people and not for particular sect of people. Whether we had created more structured or more worse only the future generations can answer this and we cannot ideally. Lastly, it is not the ease of living that has to be made convenient for future generations, it is working for resilient living for happy life "

" Guruji, by this way each and everyone should co-operate for this act on making future generations. However, it is not a '***just world***' that we live in " said the Shishya furiously.

" Very Good that you have realized that this is not a '***just world***' ; But who has made it so ? "

" I don't know Guruji " said Shishya abruptly to avoid answering that question.

Guruji understood his status quo and continued , " As i have said a while ago, this world has been running on its own for millions of years. For the world there is nothing like a '***just world***' or a '***real world***', this term is only applicable for our species out of many species in this world."

" These terms are born out of thought process when we have started interacting with the environment for our survival needs. You have to accept that out of all species, humans have the highest intelligence and this is where we can arrive at what is right and what is not right for our rightful way of living "

Shishya is a non emotive way said, " I'm able to recollect to other disciples when you were saying that we have complicated the way of living. "

" Very rightly said; before thinking about [***LokaSamgraha***]{style="color: blue"} individual has to un-complicate his life around him, only then he can un-complicate the lives around.  Since, we added complexity in our life we are saying that  ' *it is not a '**just world**'* ' "

Shishya who has now got into a relaxed mode said , " Most of the people to earn their livelihood however has to interact with the environment of the  *'**just world**'*. How can we not complicate our life ? "
