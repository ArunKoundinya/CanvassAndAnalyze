Assume that I stole few trademark recipes from best master chefs. Later, luckily I happen to create a decent restaurant using that recipes which turns to be a block buster.

After a year of successful stint what happens to the master chef and to me.   1)  Does chef thinks that Arun has stole all my creativity and planning for a revenge?   2)  Does Arun is thinking to employ a better chef as now he has been running a successful restaurant over a year.

In a filmy world either of them happens for sure and depending on point of view of the protagonist there will be a happy ending.

However, in the real world. Creativity never ends for the creator. If there is a stealth of the activity the creator in this next version would like to ensure that the replicability becomes difficult if stolen. Also, on the other side by nature creator creates new recipes; he/she feels that stealing happens and need not to worry on that much.

On the other side, by nature Arun steals and keeps on stealing the recipes until the public finds out and call him a CopyCat.

The above excerpt is about extreme personalities. How can a middle person survive from CopyCats or stop worrying about CopyCats.

*Can there be a process for Creativity where-in Habit of Creativity can be learned which seems to be restricted to only artists.*

There has been 'n' number of articles on the same. This article would be one among the many. Anyways I feel you may like it.

[***What are the drivers for Creativity***]{.underline}:\
   1) How come a child by nature crawls on the floor without being told or trained by anyone else?\
   2) Why do a few countries generate most of the patents for the world?\
   3) Why few companies died out and average death rate of companies is increasing reducing in numbers? And why other sustain the storm? and How others create the storm?\
   4) How come the creative people knows a lot about something?\
\
These are few questions that came into my mind before started to think about writing the blog.\
\
To be straight to the point:\
\
Well Known Levers are\
   A. Think like a Child and be Inquisitive.\
   B. Have Freedom in your Thought Process.\
   C. Support and Encouragement or the Work Group we are part of.\
   D. Practice & Practice.\
\
Fifth most Lever which is often less discussed as I look at it is:\
   E. Depth of the Knowledge you possess it\
\
What Happens if you have depth? And What needs to have depth?\
  -\> Interpretation is left to the person.\
\
[***What is the Process for Generating Creativity***]{.underline}:\
Once we understand the theoretical understanding of the levers. How to implement it or how to create a habit of Creativity Generation.\
\
Habit works in a loop of cue, routine and reward. { As learnt from Charles Duhigg }\
\
Reward is something you are coming up with new ideas which are original and have depth.\
Cue is something like drinking a coffee in a balcony in the morning.\
We have to add the list of activities in the routine: { In Steps }\
  -\> Being Inquisitive\
  -\> Learning & Upgradation on the thoughts after becoming inquisitive\
  -\> Practice & Practice\
\
For Ex: If you want to be creative at creating a new recipe.\
Routine Step:\
   -\> A Strange childish thought came to your mind. Is it possible to fusion Mexican taco with Italian pasta and come up with a new creamy and protein filling for taco.\
   -\> Learning about Science of Pasta and Tacos and Ingredients.\
   -\> Practice what you thought.\
\
And then reward yourself with a pat on your back for a step of improvement.\
\
This will help to harness creativity and create original ideas within society and families for a better future economy.\

Listing the Bibliography such that the better conclusion and analysis can be arrived for the readers as per needy.\

Also, try to add and fill in the gaps where-ever applicable.\
