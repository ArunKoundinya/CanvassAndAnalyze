## 1. Self-Injury?

Self Injury can be suicidal or non-suicidal, ideally in literature self-harm is by definition non-suicidal, but it may be life-threating. Usually, people who do self-harm are more likely commit suicide.

However, for our simplicity sake lets assume that self-harm can be of two types, Non-Suicidal and Suicidal.

### 1.1 N.S.S.I (Non-Suicidal Self Injury)

Non-suicidal self-injury involves acts like cutting, burning, or hitting oneself **without the intent to die**. Though not a suicide attempt, it is a significant mental health issue associated with distress and emotional dysregulation. People may harm themselves as a way to:

-   Relieve intense emotional pain
-   Regain a sense of control
-   Express feelings they can’t put into words
-   Punish themselves for perceived faults
-   Feel something when they are emotionally numb

While NSSI doesn’t involve the intent to die, it can become a habitual coping mechanism, making it harder for individuals to seek healthier emotional outlets. Importantly, **NSSI can increase the risk of future suicidal behavior**, as the threshold for self-harm lowers over time.

[*Facts*:]{.underline} NSSI is most common among adolescents and young adults, with lifetime prevalence rates between 15–20%, typically beginning around age 13–14.

### 1.2 S.S.I (Suicidal Self Injury)

**Suicidal self-injury (SSI)**, on the other hand, is done with the intention to end one’s life. It’s an act of despair not just physical harm but a cry for the end of suffering. Unlike NSSI, where survival is part of the intent, SSI reflects a perceived absence of hope, connection, or purpose.

However, many who attempt suicide may not always want to die, but they want the pain to stop. This distinction is crucial for prevention and intervention efforts.

Suicidal behaviors may result in either fatal or non-fatal outcomes:

graph TD;
    A[Suicides] -- Person Survives --> B[Non-Fatal];
    A -- Results in Death --> C[Fatal];
```

[*Not so,but important fact*:]{.underline} Suicides is among top 10 leading cause of deaths world-wide. There are an estimated 10 to 20 million non-fatal attempted suicides every year

## 2. What is Suicide?

Suicide is the act of intentionally ending one’s life. It’s rarely caused by a single factor rather, it’s an outcome of complex interactions between psychological, social, and biological elements.

Commonly, suicide is viewed as an act of hopelessness, but in reality, it can stem from a web of causes: prolonged stress, trauma, loneliness, illness, financial or social failure, and lack of perceived support.

Suicide rates vary across age groups, genders, regions, and cultures. **Men are statistically more likely to die by suicide**, whereas **women report more non-fatal attempts**. This suggests that intent and method also play roles in outcomes.

## 3. Why People Commit Suicide?

There’s no single reason, but several recurring themes appear across research:

-   **Mental Health Disorders**
    -   Depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia are leading risk factors. In many cases, the person experiences unbearable psychological pain.
-   **Social Isolation and Loneliness**
    -   Human beings are wired for connection. When those bonds break through loss, separation, or neglect suicidal thoughts can emerge.
-   **Hopelessness and Loss of Purpose**
    -   A sense that “things will never get better” is a strong predictor of suicidal ideation.
-   **Substance Abuse**
    -   Alcohol and drugs lower inhibitions and impair judgment, making impulsive suicide attempts more likely.
-   **Trauma or Abuse**
    -   Past trauma, physical, emotional, or sexual can create long-lasting wounds that manifest as self-destructive behavior.
-   **Chronic Illness or Pain**
    -   Long-term physical suffering, especially when accompanied by mental strain, can push individuals toward suicidal ideation.
-   **Socioeconomic Pressures**
    -   Debt, unemployment, or humiliation can amplify feelings of worthlessness and failure.

## 4. Why It Matters — The Larger Impact

Suicide is not merely an individual tragedy but a global public health crisis.

1.  Every 40 seconds, someone dies by suicide (WHO, 2023).
2.  For each suicide death, there are estimated to be 20 or more attempts.
3.  Families, friends, and communities are left with long-lasting grief and guilt.

Beyond the emotional toll, suicide affects workplaces, healthcare systems, and social structures. Every death ripples outward, often causing secondary trauma in others.

Importantly, suicide is preventable with awareness, early detection, and support. Conversations like these matter because talking openly can save lives.

## 6. What's in Part 02

In Part 02, we’ll dive into real-world data:

1.  Patterns and statistics across countries and age groups
2.  Gender differences and cultural dimensions
3.  Temporal trends and possible correlations (e.g., economy, social media)
4.  Visualization of datasets using open data sources

## 6. What's in Part 03

In Part 03, we’ll go beyond data:

-   Is there still a social stigma attached to suicide and self-harm?
-   How can communities identify early indicators?
-   Practical recommendations and policy-level insights
