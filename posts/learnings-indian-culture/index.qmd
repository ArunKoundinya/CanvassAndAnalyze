The Comprehension of Indian Culture has lost in the personalities of the gods we created and the corresponding norms which were picked from our vedas. The offshoots of these norms have been made to selective tenets to uphold the spirit of the tradition.

However, we had (or) need to follow the societal tenets and norms such that we become not too aloof from the society. This is important as where-in we can start our enquiry as to why such a norm/tenet is there.

Alas!!! That's a long route.

The Crux of Indian Spirit of Culture can be found in its [***Upanishads***]{.underline}. Most of us including me till now has not read either the Upanishads or the Bhagavadgita ( *Essential Quick Summaries of 108 Upanishads* ) as it is not a compulsion for us.

Let me try to explain the crux of thought process of Upanishads with a trademark example of old movie projector. ( As per my Comprehension )

 How do we view a movie on the Screen; Light has to fall on the movie reel which is been rotated by the wheel/motor system and in-turn that reel image is being imposed on the lens which gets enlarged and seen on the silver screen.

This is exactly how we see the world; 

-   Light is our Intelligence

-   Reel is our Thought Process or Information Available

-   Wheel is the brain that process the information or thought process

-   Lens are our senses and can be equated to Eyes

-   Screen is the world that we see

But who is running the show?

You can treat Upanishads as series of research books that has been well explored and written by many brilliant minds who in reality has actually explored the world within.

***To Conclude***, the spirit of Indian Culture lies in understanding the absolute reality by demolishing the myths around us; which has been consistently told to us that great revelations can happen only by inward looking.

*These are two books written by Sarvepalli Radhakrishna who is the 2nd President of our Country and the unknown coincidence is that we celebrate his birthday as teachers day every year.*

Hope you may read them and share your experiences and comprehensions as well. I have just started them.
