Knight G1 to F3 is usually considered as an aggressive opening move in chess. Beginners usually get alerted when the opponent begins his game with this step.

Does it has a distinctive advantage!!!!

When i asked couple of my friends, they clearly said that it may help; but the core of the game lies in how we manage and control the centre of the board.

Usually I consider Chess as a high cerebral game as we need to calculate several permutations ahead ( say at-least for two steps ahead ) to take incharge of the chessboard. When there is no first move advantage then why to grope our heads in making the move first! (or) if someone is ahead because of his first move ; Core game is to take incharge on game and not on first right move.

If we extend this to a society setting; it makes no such difference. I have myself experienced where-in i have changed my opine about a person after framing my first impression ( I bet most of you would have too ). Still we dwell so much on how to create a first best impression as there is an existing belief i.e.; first best impression will be a lasting impression.

[***Note***]{.underline}*: The First Impressions might be good if the situation is a transient like an interview on a business pitch in an elevator descent etc.; However, there are many cases we would have listened these days that job fitment or business value proposition rules in either of the places than the invisible or intangible first impression we want to create.*

This has been an interesting thought process that came to my mind today; Hope you may add or refute to the thought process.

Why to worry on the invisible/intangible tool if that doesn't fit in your toolkit?

To Conclude, It is **both the means and the end goal that matters** and not either of them or nor the milestones flagships.
