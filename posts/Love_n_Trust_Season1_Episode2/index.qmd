[*A few years ago,*]{.underline}

A young girl in her early twenties, draped in an exquisite blue coloured silk saree, nervously waiting for her loved one outside an Engineering college. 

Her dilated eyes turned misty when she saw a resembled face from a distance, and then she started flying towards him and hugged him tightly and said, "I love you, Sanjay". { Yes, this is the same Sanjay of the first Episode }

"Pooja, there are so many students and lecturers around".

She heard nothing but clutched him more tightly as if he would slip away from her. 

Sanjay responded by kissing her forehead and said, "Love you too, Pooja",

After feeling his kiss, Pooja came to her senses and said, "I'm sorry, Sanjay. I couldn't stop myself as we are meeting after a couple of years".

He took her to the nearest Ganapathi mandir, which is a few miles away from his University and vowed that he would never leave her hand under any circumstances.

"I'm incredibly sorry that I had to ditch you because of our minor misunderstandings at that time. I never imagined you would come over again for me. "

"Thanks to social media, I have been following you under a ghost account for the last year. So, it was effortless to find you and your Univ. But, you never felt to look for me, Sanjay, after we broke up?"

"I did. But I felt guilty about what I did for you? I'm sorry," Sanjay said as tears rolled out his eyes.

Pooja kissed his cheek and said, " I love you. Let us be together again forever."

"It is tough to find a loved one. It's tougher to find a loved one who knocked on your door. How can I leave you?"

They hugged inside the temple as if air couldn't pass through them. They spent their time till dawn and had a sumptuous dinner in a nearby eatery, and later Sanjay dropped her at her University, which was just two hundred miles away.

It took a year to find out for Pooja that Sanjay was running a parallel story along with Swati, Sanjay's classmate.

She came to know this when she decided to surprise Sanjay for Valentine's day; however, to her surprise, she saw them going into a theatre cuddling each other. At that moment, she wants to quarrel with him then. But, out of her unparalleled love towards him, she left the place in tears.

Pooja felt that if she showed her true love to him, he would return with unconditional love. So she waited a couple of months to see whether Sanjay would confess to his behaviour. But, it never took to that course of action.

Pooja doesn't want to turn this into a bitter relationship and a nasty breakup. But chose to avoid him consistently in the name of her career and aspirations. In the beginning, it turned him off; nonetheless,  having a backup, he picks to settle with Swati rather than search for true love.

On the other side, Pooja sobbed for months to overcome this trouble backstabbed relationship.

*Back to Present in Psychotherapy Clinic*

" Please wait outside or speak to my receptionist for the next queue. I'm already engaged with a client", said Swati's mother, the therapist.

Receptionist said, "Sir, there is a waiting for 30 mins. I request you to please wait in the lobby".

"Sure"

He walked towards the lobby and saw a beautiful woman draped in a blue saree. She looked engrossed in reading a cine magazine, and it took a while for his dull mind to recognise that she was none other than Pooja. 

He felt on cloud nine to see her at the right time and thanked God for this moment. 

" Pooja, How are you?"

Pooja casually looked at Sanjay, then got excited to see him again after a couple of years and said, " I'm amazing. How are you?"

" I'm fantastic too."

" How come you are here, Sanjay ?"

" I came here for a counselling session; I'm going through a tough phase in my life. And how come you are here, Pooja? Are you here for counselling too?"

" No"

" Let me guess. Are you working here?"

She smiled and said, "No. But I'm surprised that you contemplated a counselling session. These days men are evolving as vulnerable and untrained to manage themselves."

"Times change, Pooja, and men have a heart too! And I couldn't stop flattering you; you look ravishing and stunning."

Pooja beamed and said, "Thank you!!!!"

" It is fine. But, first, tell me why you are here?"

Pooja smiled and said," I'm here for my Husband. He is presently having a counselling session with the therapist."
