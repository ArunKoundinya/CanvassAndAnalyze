Since our childhood until to our death there are many gurus/well-wisher/teachers/friends who helped us to learn, helped us to keep intact of what we are good at and helped us to unlearn. Without their contribution it is very tough to assume our current position as a sole contributor.

Also, albeit in this commercial phase; i.e.; being our academic/professional places being more ROI driven, we still owe to at-least few gurus who shaped us as a better person.

In the last blog we have seen where Rishis has handpicked few of theirs' disciples and thought them the learnings from the showman. 

Like how we get ourselves owed to our gurus; A blessed and blissful disciple would thy become a devotee for 'the blissful guru', who has explained about the inner secrets of human life without any strings attached.

And thus we would place his guru at pinnacle and thy worship him as ***Guru Brahma, Guru Vishnu, Guru devo Maheshwara; Guru sakshat, param Brahma, tasmai shri guravay namah***.

-   ***Brahma*** is called in Indian Culture as ***Creator*** of World

-   ***Vishnu*** is referred as ***Maintenance*** of World

-   ***Shiva*** is referred as ***Destroyer*** of World

-   ***ParaBharma*** is ***Self***  {our language - Showman} i.e.; Brahman -\> Mentioned in Upanishads and Gita { Refer Link - [Brahman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahman) }

The Enlightened Disciple would be praising his guru as comparing to Brahma, Vishnu & Shiva. As comparing to Knowledge giver, Solution Seeker & Destroyer of Ignorance i.e.; in Contemporary we refer as Learn, Intact & Unlearn. 

Also final verse explains; about the enlightened Disciple who thy realised that the enlightenment is in realising about the true nature of showman i.e.; in Contemporary we refer the real guru is self inquiry and the inner guiding light. { [*Ref the Pic below: When the Student is Ready, the teacher will appear*]{.underline} }

This worship to God {Supreme God i.e.; [Showman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahman)} is also been called as [Bhakti Yoga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhakti_yoga) { Bhakti Marga} in our Indian Culture. It is usually referred to as devotion of trust and love to a personal God.

In the last three blogs I have learnt about [Jnana Yoga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jnana_yoga), [Karma Yoga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karma_yoga) and [Bhakti Yoga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhakti_yoga) which are referred as the three spiritual paths in our Culture to realize  about the Supreme God i.e.; our Showman.
