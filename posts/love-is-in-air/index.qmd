Who doesn't want to celebrate it every day. It is such a lovely thought to be keep it sustained for-ever. The challenge is to keep the positive energy sustained that spreads around them.

I am going to narrate a conversation excerpt between my father and me.

[*Dad*]{.underline}: How are you, my boy? [*Arun*]{.underline}: I am doing good!!! Dad. Very excited to get married. [*Dad*]{.underline}: I am going to share my experience with you. Hope it might be helpful to you.

In a new relationship, each-other expectations would be in two parallel lines. Both of them would get worried to see and digest the others expectations.

The two parallel lines can never meet and there will be a strain in the relationship. The beauty lies in the meeting point of the two lines which can happen when both of them lower their expectations and change as per others expectation (few of them ). Because we are humans and not super humans.

Earlier I thought lowering our expectation is a compromise. But if our relationship prospers and doesn't compromise because of our compromise. Then what is the wrong in getting compromised? Compromising is not about lowering ourselves. It is about respecting the others limitations as well. Once, we understanding this equation; i feel we respect others opine and start reaching to their expectation as well. If Trust is the positive energy that gels between them; then the compromise acts like a protection shield that embraces the trust. Then truly love is in the air for-ever.

[*Note*]{.underline}: The most common reason for stress and anxiety these days is because we are having a tough time to make a trustful relationship for longer duration leading to 'lack of belongingness'.
