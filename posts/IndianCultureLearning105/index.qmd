[*Continuing from previous blogs*]{.underline}:

We have observed where the Rishi who gets enlightened through self inquiry with a true inherent desire to meet the Showman. As  they experience the Showman; they shares the similar experience to his few selected disciples and thus 'the Rishi' becomes 'the Guru'.  Whom have created a way for each and everyone of us (In terms of Personal God) to get us liberated and realize the Showman within ourselves.

Most Common Questions that Pop-us for few of us is: 

1.  Why the Gurus preached about the Celibacy when the Personal Gods are married

2.  On top of it; Why Personal Gods has opted for Polygamy

Hope the article will help you to rethink or reframe these questions in a different way.

We have discussed in previous blogs where Gurus picks up few of his disciples and trains them to become liberated. They make take few months, years or decades depending upon the time invested by that disciple for the realisation of the Showman. Until finally those disciples become Gurus.

The person who is trying to realize the showman is termed as "[Brahmacarya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahmacarya)". {*Bharaman(Showman) + Charya(Going After)*} 

Interesting to realize that "***Brahmacarya***" can be practised by anybody and there is no gender bias, caste bias, marriage status, age bias etc.; It is all about getting oneself liberated and realize the showman. During the process they would realize they had to empty out the desires and once they realize the showman; they don't need any internal enforcement to abstain from desires.

M. K. Gandhi is a recent well-known married Bramacharya. Who Practised Brahmacharya to gain Liberation. He preached and practiced the concepts of Brahamcharya for which he gained the popularity world-wide.

[Gandhi  & His Experiments on Bharamacharya](https://www.mkgandhi.org/health/keytohealth/index.htm) 

Concept of the Brahmacarya (Which is an Over-all LifeStyle for Spiritual Liberation) doesn't mean Celibacy. The Joy/Bliss that you obtain from realization of showman makes the pleasures that we seek meaningless. It doesn't translate to otherwise.

[*Page-65: Introductory Essay \| Bhagavadgita \| S. RadhaKrishnan*]{.underline}

Over-All Style usually includes and not limited to Humility, Obedience, Readiness to Serve, Compassion and Gentle Love, Renounce Self-Well and  experience passivity and several others. If you observe closely, these qualities that are more feminine in nature and character. Feminity is in all beings.

So, we have to experience Feminity within ourselves and thus Empowering the ***Shakti*** within ourselves. (The little well-known purana i.e.; [Devi-Bhagavata Purana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devi-Bhagavata_Purana).) - It can be translated as w/o Shakti it is impossible to realize the showman.

Personal Gods that we have seen are the Qualities within ourselves such that if we realize them it would be a path for the God. By the time a person/Rishi/Guru realizes all the qualities in thyself becomes ShaktiMan and have a serene life under the arms of Showman.

The Representation of the above concept has turned into the below visual representation and others. Visual Representation can be many but the realization for the Showman is only One.
