[*Continuing from previous blogs*]{.underline}:

We have observed where the Rishi who gets enlightened through self inquiry with a true inherent desire to meet the Showman; they would like to come forward to share the similar experience to his few selected disciples; and thus 'the Rishi' becomes 'the Guru'.  Who have created a way for each and everyone of us (In terms of Personal God) to get us liberated and realize the Showman within ourselves. And then we learnt that people who embark a travel to meet the showman are termed as 'Brahmacharya'; To get motivated to meet the showman they start to pray the Sun who is more visible and tangible; and then continue their path for the ultimate showman.

Rishis Disciple is now in a confusion mode asking about the inner light dualities among the people and again got into confusion when he envisaged that his realization to showman has to be Sacrificed to realize him. His question of "*why pooja*" made him to realize that it should not be a ritual but a method to concentrate to realize the god. Whatever work we do, if we perform as per direction of showman we will attain peace and not thinking about the reward and living out of vicious loop of Gunas.

Now Shishya is trying to learn about the pains and its conflicts.

We left the previous blog with this question.

After few moments, " How can we get out of the conflict zone!! Guruji. ",  asks Shishya restlessly.

[[***And then Rishi/Guru responds in this way***]{.underline}:]{style="color: #6aa84f;"}

Guruji smiles and responds, " How do you define a zone? "

" It means a territory; I'm assuming that you want me to re-define my question. Here it goes, how to get out of the conflict-territory that we habitually dwell?"

Guruji again responds with serene smile, " Don't dwell in that territory? " 

" What would be the course. If we cannot come out of that territory? "

Guruji quickly answers, " This statement conflicts with your question itself. A while ago, you want to come out of that zone and now you are insisting that you cannot come out of that zone. Succinctly, you are pre-meditated to dwell in the conflict zone " 

Shishya pauses for a minute and closes his eyes and pray, " Guruji, let me rephrase my question. How to avoid being in that conflict zone ? "

" Picking up from our earlier conversation ([*last blog*](https://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning118/)),  conflict arises due to the interaction effect of past to present. Ideally, we have to start with a fresh slate of mind every moment in our life! "

Shishya interrupted with anxiety and asked, " Are you saying that we should have a consistent memory loss "

Guruji says while he is signalling to sit on the bench," That dead tree has become this bench with the aid of our memory. I don't underestimate the power of our minds. What I mean is not to ax all the living trees because Guruji is enjoying his comfort on that bench. As we have formed an opinion based on what we observe from the original fact in the entire prejudice hierarchy "

*Watch from the 6th Minute onwards*

Guruji continues, " The conflict surfaces whenever we accept our opinions, our beliefs, and our so-called  prejudices as mere facts. And this assumed fact will have a conflict with reality, as it is not the fact. To avoid that conflict we should have a fresh slate of mind, which means to stop forming opinions and just observe. "

Shishya looks as if his quench for knowledge is done. However, within a moment with his unrest expression, " It looks good on paper, would that be possible or is it a practical solution? "
