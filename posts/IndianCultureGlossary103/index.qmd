Before we move our identity from **ATMAN** to **BRAHMAN**, it is necessary to establish identity with **ATMAN.** As leading thyself comes before leading others.

*We left the previous blog with this question:*

But how can we move our identity to BRAHMAN? Are there any Universal rules or guiding principles?

![](image.png){fig-align="center" width="731"}

Yes, there are Universal rules called "eternal laws" termed as **Sanātana Dharma**. 

If we observe, the "Sun" is one the most prominent source of our life. How can Sun provide so much energy for generations after generations? 

On a spiritual dimension, Sun is a perfect live example of "eternal laws" in action. ( Link to an earlier series blog - Our Relatable Personal God )

-   Sun generates the energy within

-   It gives power but doesn't take it back.

-   It shows up every day with the same intensity.

-   It plays a prominent role in all the seasons to occur.

-   It holds together the planets of the solar system with its gravitational pull.

-   It doesn't tell how to radiate. But powers light to reflect thyself.

All the above sentences summarize - being in "***Service***" and "***Awareness***". This is all about **Sanātana Dharma.**

Alternatively, if we try to link Suns' way of life to us, it translates as follows:

-   Constant Self Inquiry leads us to a state of "Consciousness," i.e., being with our showman. Wherein we get enlightened about ourselves.

-   Once we are enlightened, it is about giving back knowledge to the seekers through self-inquiry.

-   Results don't matter when being in "Service". It is about being dutiful to one's prescribed duty.

 Above three looks familiar in our journey of the previous series of blogs. { Summarised in this version of the blog - Link }

**Sanātana Dharma** is about the way of living and is not related to any religion, which is the crux of Indian culture.

[P.S.: Scientifically, Sun radiates its energy by nuclear fusion. It means it has to lose itself, i.e., mass, to release energy. The most exciting fact is that by the time the Sun becomes a white dwarf, it would only reduce 1% of the Sun's mass. Thus, just 1% of the Sun's mass generates energy for 4 billion years.]{style="color: #6aa84f;"}
