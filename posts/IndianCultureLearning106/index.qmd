[*Continuing from previous blogs*]{.underline}:

We have observed where the Rishi who gets enlightened through self inquiry with a true inherent desire to meet the Showman. As  they experience the Showman; they shares the similar experience to his few selected disciples and thus 'the Rishi' becomes 'the Guru'.  Whom have created a way for each and everyone of us (In terms of Personal God) to get us liberated and realize the Showman within ourselves. And then we learnt that people who embark a travel to meet the showman are termed as 'Brahmacharya';

 On their journey; the most common question that pops-up in the mind is that *are there any relatable personal gods i.e.; whom we can see them everyday and remind us about the showman and conduct Brahmacarya*?

It is always esoteric for most of us to imagine the showman on how he looks and to draw an inspiration from him. Ideally, to get a strong and ever-lasting inspiration either we need to hear first hand stories about him or see him every day. 

Thus it would be obvious for us to look back about the basic elements of our creation i.e.; [Pancha Bhoota](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancha_Bhoota).  And then deities like Sun, Moon, Fire, Sky, Earth, Wind, Water etc.; has been started to get worship. These natural form of deities have been mentioned in [Rig Veda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigveda) which represents as one of the earliest phase of evolution of religious consciousness. 

Mitra, Varuna & Agni are the three eyes of the great illuminator Sun. When worship is accorded to any of the Vedic deities, we tend to make that deity, [*the Supreme One ( Showman)*]{.underline}, of whom all others are forms or manifestations. { [*Page 33 from The Prinicipal Upanishads by S. Radhakrishnan*]{.underline} }

As deities presiding over groups of natural phenomena became identified; The Various forms of Sun-Gods tended to be looked upon as one; Usually it is logical to draw inspiration from ***Sun*** as it is a lively body which makes us to en-liven ourselves and come out of darkness everyday. { *Also, scientifically all the life in this planet is Solar Powered i.e.; gift provided by Sun* }

For a person who wants to transverse the path from reciting the Hymns to 'search for the reality underlying' requires a particular concentration of deity; may be related personal god i.e.; Surya; Who then can further lead to explore the unmanifested one (showman) and gain liberation on his journey of Brahmacarya.
