------------------------------------------------------------------------

The morning was fresh and bright. Birds chirped outside, and the first sun rays gently touched Raj’s eyes as he stirred awake in bed.

A deep sense of calm washed over him, filling his mind with peace as he stepped onto the balcony, sipping his morning coffee. The day felt full of promise, a quiet hope blossoming within him.

Just then, his phone buzzed with a message, “Babe! Can we meet today?”

He smiled softly, replying with joy tempered by calm, **“Yes! Of course, babe!!”**

Curious, Raj opened his social media feed. Maybe it was because of his recent watches that the algorithm presented glimpses that made him not only desirable but also extremely aroused.

Within minutes, that gentle calm shifted. Scrolling through the feed, his breathing quickened, his eyes widening with growing need. The steady heartbeat gave way to a restless pulse.

Almost unconsciously, he switched to incognito mode on his browser and navigated to Locanto, a site promising hidden encounters.

He sifted through countless fake profiles, encounters meant to frustrate. But he knew the difference, only those who walked this path could recognize it.

Finally, luck smiled. He found a real connection, someone genuine in the shadows. 

And it is  post-lunch appointment awaited for him, an escape lurking just hours away.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

He glanced over at his roommate, still wrapped in deep sleep, and chose not to disturb him.

Quietly, he opened the Zomato app, ordered his favorite, Mutton Biryani from Shah Ghouse, and ate it with a contented smile. Afterwards, he indulged in a deep, refreshing bath.

Once ready, he mounted his bike and rode to the nearest pharmacy to pick up the ammunition he needed for the meeting. Prepared, he made his way to the appointed place.

As the door opened, the woman greeted him softly, *“Are you Raj?”*

He nodded, *“Yes, that’s me.”*

She fixed her gaze on him, *“Payment first, please.”*

Without hesitation, he handed her the cash. Their eyes met with an unspoken tension sparking in the space between them.

“Now,” she began, *“tell me, what are your fantasies?”*

Raj smiled gently. *“I have plenty of fantasies. but before I speak of mine, I want to know yours.”*

Her brow furrowed in surprise. **“What? No customer has ever asked me that.”**

He chuckled softly. *“Do you really think I’m just another customer? If I were, I would’ve booked your service without questions. But the moment I saw your face, I felt something different, it is not just desire but a feeling to hug you.”*

She sighed, a hint of weariness in her voice. “Don’t give me false hopes. This is just a job, and emotions have no place here.”

He leaned in a little, earnest. *“Let me serve you, not just for now but beyond what you expect.”*

She smiled, a little shaken but cautious. “Don’t lose yourself hoping for more.”

“I’ve met many before,” he said softly, *“but never have I craved to serve someone like you.”*

The conversation melted into laughter and shared glances, and soon, they were lost to the world outside. And then they had fun like two souls finding unexpected warmth in one another’s company.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

He returned home and took a cold shower, either to punish himself like trying to wash away the weight of his actions or to soothe his restless body. But he moved deliberately, calmly, purposely, savoring each slow, cleansing moment.

Stepping out, he found Sanjay waiting in the living room, his roommate and silent observer of Raj's familiar rhythms.

Sanjay shook his head and asked bluntly, “Raj, isn’t it wrong? You’ve got a girlfriend, yet here you are chasing after someone else, just to satisfy your cravings.”

Raj laughed, a spark of mischief lighting his eyes. “Sanjay, man, Life!!! is like a masala movie, isn’t it? Every good masala film needs an item song, *"some spice"* "
Sanjay got no words with Raj response!

Raj continued, **" Well, my life’s gotta be a Pan-India Block Bluster. You get what I mean?”**

Sanjay just stared, momentarily stunned into silence.

Raj smirked, grabbed his keys, and headed out with a confident grin. “Time to see my girl.”

------------------------------------------------------------------------

He rode his bike with the reckless lightness of a teenager, heart pounding with anticipation.

Pulling up near the park, the familiar spot where she always waited, he cut the engine gently and stepped off.

His eyes found her immediately as she waited by the pond, nestled beneath the wide spreading branches of the blossoming tree.

Quiet as a shadow, he tiptoed up behind her and wrapped his arms around her waist.

“Hey babe,” he whispered softly, *“I’ve been thinking about you all morning. I love you so much.”*

She turned in his embrace, eyes shining with warmth. **“Love you too, babe.”**

He smiled, voice trembling with gratitude and awe. “**Vaisharaaa**, I’m the luckiest man on this planet to have found you.”
