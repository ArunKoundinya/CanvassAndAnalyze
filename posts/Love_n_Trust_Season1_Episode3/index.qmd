Sanjay couldn't believe Pooja was married. His face went pale, and a sharp envy flickered in his eyes. Without another word, he made an excuse about a work call and hurried away.

On the drive home, tears blurred his vision, his mind blank. Once he reached his room, he broke down, crying as if the world had just ended. After a while, he caught his breath, wiped his face, and steadied himself.

*"If Pooja and Swati have moved on, that's their issue, not my fault," he muttered to himself. "The world doesn't end with them. There are plenty of other girls in my contacts. I bet someone would be up for a dinner date tonight."*

He unlocked his phone, scrolling through his contacts. Then his finger stopped on one name—Pravallika.

***Few Years Ago***

A slender teenager in a blue churidar waited at the high school bus stop, even as dusk settled. After a few minutes, Sanjay arrived and greeted her with a warm smile.

"Pravalli, have you been waiting long? Am I late?" he asked.

Pravallika smiled softly. "It’s okay, Sanjay. I enjoy waiting for you. Not just now, but forever!"

They hugged each other, a moment filled with genuine love.

***Back to Present***

A smile crept over Sanjay's face. He knew Pravallika would pick up his call. He dialed her number eagerly and spoke with a flirty charm until she agreed to join him for a dinner buffet at Ohris.

With four hours to kill, he shaved, took a long bubble bath, and dressed up in his best New Year's outfit. He booked an Uber and settled in for the ride, closing his eyes as memories of his teenage years flooded back.

***Teenage Period***

"Sanjay, you look so handsome today! What’s the occasion?"

"Pravalli, it’s your birthday, babe. I had to look my best so I could make it special for you."

"Awww! So sweet, baby!"

***Back to Present***

His phone buzzed, and he answered eagerly. Pravallika's voice was on the other end. "Sanjay, I’ve just left home. I’ll be there soon."

Sanjay’s face lit up. "See you soon, babe!" he replied, then hung up, drifting back into old memories.

***Teenage Period***

"Babe, can I kiss you?" he asked.

"I'm all yours, Sanjay. You don’t have to ask."

They shared several kisses, like a couple deeply connected, as if they'd known each other forever.

***Back to Present***

“Sir, we’re here,” the driver announced.

“Thanks for the ride,” Sanjay replied.

He walked toward the elevator to reach the rooftop restaurant. As he stepped in, he overheard a couple arguing, their voices laced with cuss words. It triggered another memory.

***Teenage Period***

"Sanjay, why were you sexting that girl?"

"Pravalli, she was hot, and I couldn’t help myself. It’s just texts—it's not like we're actually doing anything."

"Babe, am i not sufficient for you? We’ve shared everything except… that."

"Pravalli, it is too early to commit to one girl for life long. I'm still a teenager."

"Sanjay, what are you saying? you are making me mad! This is making me crazy!"

"Pravalli, i think its time for break up. If i realized my love again i will get in touch you"

"Sanjay, you're an assole. Don’t ever talk to me again!"

"F\*\*\* off Pravalli",he shot back, deleting her contact on the spot and he left the place.

***Back to Present***

The elevator doors slid open. He came out of the elevator and scared and worried whether he could face Pravallika. And He called Pravallika from the hotel lobby.

"Our system crashed. I’ve got to head to the office—just got a call. Sorry!" saying these words, he turned and left the hotel.

Pravallika, who was seeing him, while sitting inside the reasturant said, "Its Okay Sanjay. We can meet next time."

She said to herself, "At least he’s still nervous to face me. I’m happy about that. And maybe it’s time that I should help him."
