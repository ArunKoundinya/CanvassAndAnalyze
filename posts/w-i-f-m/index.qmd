Let us time travel in our thought process to one the first known ancient civilizations i.e.; [Çatalhöyük](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Çatalhöyük). { I'm excluding the Harappan Civilisation which in recent times made the news to be the longest and ancient civilizations of all time *(almost near to "Göbekli_Tepe"*. As still sufficient information is yet to be available for more study. }

Çatalhöyük is believed to be the first town in the history and as well believed to be the first known egalitarian society. It existed approximately at about  7,500 BCE. It seems that upto10,000 people used to lived in Catalhoyuk, which was about 1% of the global population at that time. It survived for 2,000 years which is of-course huge time.\

What is more interesting to me is that 

-   [**Agriculture**]{.underline}*: "they also grew peas, almonds and pistachios, reared sheep and cattle, and gathered fruits from the forests. Hunting is as well the main source for food*". "
-   [***Infrastructure***]{.underline}*: The tightly packed “city”was made of simple mud-brick rooms that seemed to have been added on again and again as the community grew and changed across the centuries of habitation*".
-   [**Religion**]{.underline}: "*The stately goddess seated on a throne flanked by two lionesses  was found in a grain bin, which suggests might have been a means of ensuring the harvest or protecting the food supply.In later cultures, similar depictions are seen of [Cybele](https://www.theoi.com/Phrygios/Kybele.html), a mountain goddess.*"
-   [**Mining**]{.underline}: "*here is also evidence that the settlement was the first place in the world to mine and smelt metal in the form of lead*".

Everything is almost there that is needed for a life to live in peace, harmony & prosperity.

Being an egalitarian society & no hierarchy in the society ; Çatalhöyük can as well be the first  [Anarcho-communism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchist_communism) state. Irony, is that people at that time aren't aware of this term. They seems to live an uncomplicated life of having & cultivating good food; living in neat society and places; living together as a team.

Now-a-days, we are having tough time to get along with teams even for one full day due to our over dependence on non-living things. Then how come a civilisation stayed as a team for approx. 7,30,000 days. Harmony would have lost among the society if few of them questioned to themselves W.I.F.M. Not our mistake but now our society has become fragmented and highly hierarchal (*especially in last 200 years*) which makes us to question ourselves W.I.F.M. 

However, during this span of 9000 years what seems to we have lost is that understanding and living a life - don’t think about result this creates tension in your mind give your full effort sincerely this gives the result which you deserve. This is difficult to practice But this is best practice in life.once you know the greatness of this quality, practice it everything comes for you. 

It looks like the Çatalhöyük Soceity has followed the same for 7,30,000 days as also has strong faith on Kartha, Karma & Kriya Process which allowed them to work as a team.

-   KARTA = Performer. 
-   KRIYA = Method/Implementation. 
-   KARMA = Consequences.

W.I.F.M may be good for short term survival. However, if those ancestors and our ancestors would have thought on those same lines we would not be such a privileged society with all the basic comforts.

To conclude, KRIYA is the only thing that is in our hands that helps to work in positive direction to do value addition for the betterment for the future and existing society.
