[*Continuing from previous blogs*]{.underline}:

We have observed where the Rishi who gets enlightened through self inquiry with a true inherent desire to meet the Showman; they would like to come forward to share the similar experience to his few selected disciples; and thus 'the Rishi' becomes 'the Guru'.  Who have created a way for each and everyone of us (In terms of Personal God) to get us liberated and realize the Showman within ourselves. And then we learnt that people who embark a travel to meet the showman are termed as 'Brahmacharya'; To get motivated to meet the showman they start to pray the Sun who is more visible and tangible; and then continue their path for the ultimate showman.

Rishis Disciple is now in a confusion mode asking about the inner light dualities among the people and again got into confusion when he envisaged that his realization to showman has to be Sacrificed to realize him. His question of "*why pooja*" made him to realize that it should not be a ritual but a method to concentrate to realize the god. Whatever work we do, if we perform as per direction of showman we will attain peace.

We left the previous with this question.

 " Dhanyotsmi Guruji, But how would we know that *this is the work* of HIS thoughts ? " Asks Shishya with excitement and love.

[[***And then Rishi/Guru responds in this way***]{.underline}::]{style="color: #6aa84f;"}

" How do you differentiate between HIS work and our work? "

Complacent Shishya said, " As you always mention Guruji, If it is driven by our thought process it can be termed as our work; If it is driven by HIS thought process it can be termed as Showmans work"

Guruji smiled and asked, " Then how do you differentiate between HIS thought process and Ours ? "

" May be Ours is shallow; And Showman's might be more holistic ? "

Guruji again smiled and said, " It is interesting that you are picking new terms and using them. Are you sure about the content that you intend to communicate ? "

Shishya nods his head with confidence.

" We need to understand that there is nothing called as shallow or holistic in Showman's thought process. It is just HIS thought process; The derivations to shallow or holistic is ours and not His"

" Then what is it Guruji ?"

Guruji went to the farm to pluck few vegetables, Shishya followed along with him " How do you feel, when you eat what you want or love ? "

" I feel happy Guruji. "'

" How do you feel when you drink Kashaya every morning ? "

" Honestly, I didn't liked it Guruji; As you mentioned that it is good for my health. I stopped relating to the drink and simply drank it "

" Interesting Pattern "

Guruji picked couple of Vegetables and walked back; and continued , " Drawing some parallel lines, when we get attached to the reward ( *either intrinsic or extrinsic* ) it directly means that the work we are performing is run by our thoughts. Consequently, when we are unattached by the rewards, it is indirectly run by HIS thoughts for [***LokaSamgraha***]{style="color: blue"}"

" Guruji, what reward do we get ? " Asks Shishya with slight commotion.

" Human Life itself is the biggest reward. It is always wise to be in constant touch with him in any work we do; And the reward of the work is attributed to him."

Shishya thinks deeply for a while and questions Guruji as , " I Understand Guruji, but if we are not led by our thoughts would it not be leading to our ignorance ; which you usually refer to as Tamasa Guna? "
