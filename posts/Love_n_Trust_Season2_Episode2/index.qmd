Sanjay scrolled through Pravallika’s Instagram profile, and there it was the video on top of her feed. It caught him off guard.

As he watched, a tender smile formed on his lips. **"Someone does care for me,"** he whispered to himself, feeling a warmth he hadn’t felt in a while.

But then a confusion quickly followed. “Why did she act like that yesterday?” he wondered, the memory of their last encounter still sharp in his mind.

His curiosity piqued, Sanjay decided to reach out. But just as he was about to dial her number, his eyes caught another unread message on his phone.

***“Will you trust me?”*** The message was from an unknown number, arriving at the same time as a message from Raj. The timing was unsettling.

He shook off the unease for now, focusing instead on calling Pravallika.

The phone rang, and soon, her familiar voice filled the line. But anxiety gripped him, and Sanjay ended the call abruptly.

In that moment, he felt an unknown weight on his shoulders.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

A few seconds drifted by, feeling like a decade as Sanjay's mind wandered back to his teenage years with Pravallika. Flashes of their love, romance, and the painful memory of how he had left her played in his mind.

But his reverie was interrupted by an incoming call. It was Pravallika.

He picked up, trying to steady his voice, "Hi Pravallika. How are you?"

"Hi Sanjay," she replied, her voice tinged with a mix of warmth and worry, still processing her recent conversation with Swati.

Sanjay paused before asking again, "Hi, how are you?"

"I'm good, Sanjay. How are you?" she responded.

"I'm good, Pravallika."

"Did you have your breakfast, Sanjay?" she asked, her voice gentle.

"Not yet, Pravallika. I will in some time."

They both hesitated, unsure how to break the ice after so long. There was happiness in hearing each other's voices, yet a tension lingered in the air.

After a moment, Pravallika spoke, her voice soft and sincere, **"I'm sorry, Sanjay. Can you please forgive me for what happened the other day?"**

Sanjay's emotions shifted from happiness to elation, then to confusion. He took a deep breath, **"Pravallika, it's okay. We all get confused sometimes. I should have never said I wanted all three of you as my girlfriends. It was extremely silly of me. I deserved your reaction."**

"But..." He paused, contemplating whether to ask about the video, but decided against it. It didn't feel like the right moment.

"Continue, Sanjay..." she prompted gently.

"But, we shouldn't punish ourselves by playing these games," he shifted the conversation. "Let's celebrate our reunion today."

Pravallika's voice lit up with happiness, "This time, it's just you and me, no more surprises. But where shall we meet?"

"Your choice," Sanjay replied, feeling a sense of relief.

She thought for a moment, then suggested, "Let's meet for lunch at my place. I'll order some good biryani from Shah Ghouse. What do you say?"

"Hmm, Shah Ghouse is a good choice. I'll bring sweets and Thumsup as usual," he agreed, feeling a familiar warmth in the routine.

"See you soon then," she said, her voice carrying a smile and they ended their conversation.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sanjay took a deep breath after the call, but frustration bubbled inside him. *"What did I call for and end up setting up a date with someone I once ditched?"* he muttered to himself.

He paced around, his mind swirling with confusion. **"Do I love her? Or am I just craving her presence? Or maybe I just need company?"** he questioned himself silently.

As he prepared his breakfast, a simple dosa with chutney, some random thoughts crept in.

> "Am I just trying to fill a void?" he wondered.\
> "What if I'm making the same mistake again?"\
> "Is this really what I want, or am I just afraid of being alone?"

These thoughts lingered, weaving through his mind like threads of uncertainty.

After breakfast, he checked his phone and saw the same message from the unknown number again. This time, curiosity got the better of him, and he decided to call.

"Who is this?" he asked, his voice cautious.

"I know you might not remember me. Maybe it's my fault," the voice replied, carrying a hint of vulnerability.

Sanjay frowned, trying to place the familiar tone.

**"Your voice seems familiar, but I can't quite recollect."**

"Hey, it's me, the girl you saved last night. Vaishara," she said, her voice soft but clear.

His mind raced with questions once more.

> "Why is she calling? What does she want from me? Am I ready to deal with this?"

Yet beneath the uncertainty, a flicker of curiosity and responsibility stirred within him, compelling him to listen.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The driver arrived home, feeling the weight of the day’s events still lingering. He found his daughter, in the living room, her eyes lighting up as he entered.

"Dad, you're back! How was your day?" she asked, smiling.

He took a seat beside her, exhaling deeply. "It was quite eventful, Paavani. I helped a young woman today, Vaishaara, with something that reminded me of why your mother always insisted on kindness."

Paavani listened intently, her eyes softening with emotion.

"You know," he continued, "if your mom were alive, she'd be so happy to see how things turned out today. She always believed in helping others."

Suddenly, tears welled up in Paavani’s eyes, spilling onto her cheeks.

Her father looked at her, puzzled. "Paavani, why are you crying? Did I say something wrong?"

Paavani quickly wiped her tears, shaking her head. "No, Dad, it's not that. It's just that I was thinking about how proud Mom would be of you. And how much I miss her guidance. I just wish she was here."

Her father, still confused but tender, gently took her hand. **"I understand, beta. I miss her too. But remember what she used to say: *'Stay strong and laugh from the inside.'*"**

He hugged her tightly, reciting a verse from the Gita, hoping to bring her some comfort:

> sukla-krsne gati hy ete\
> jagatah sasvate mate\
> ekaya yaty anavrttim\
> anyayavartate punah

As the night deepened into Amavasya, they both found solace in the quiet darkness, letting the peace of the moment guide them into a restful sleep.

A long, pleasant, almost godly whisper flows through the page gently reaching those of you reading this very episode.

“**My dear lovely readers…** You might be wondering: Why does the Driver again quote the Gita so often?

But trust me, the answers await you in **ArunVerses** to come in **Chaos & Knowing** very soon.

Also, Paavani's tears will find their answer in **ArunVerses** within **Beginnings & Endings** soon.
