[*Continuing from previous blogs*]{.underline}:

We have observed where the Rishi who gets enlightened through self inquiry with a true inherent desire to meet the Showman; they would like to come forward to share the similar experience to his few selected disciples; and thus 'the Rishi' becomes 'the Guru'.  Who have created a way for each and everyone of us (In terms of Personal God) to get us liberated and realize the Showman within ourselves. And then we learnt that people who embark a travel to meet the showman are termed as 'Brahmacharya'; To get motivated to meet the showman they start to pray the Sun who is more visible and tangible; and then continue their path for the ultimate showman.

Rishis Disciple is now in a confusion mode asking about the inner light dualities among the people and again got into confusion when he envisaged that his realization to showman has to be Sacrificed to realize him. His question of "*why pooja*" made him to realize that it should not be a ritual but a method to concentrate to realize the god.

We left the previous blog where Shishya approaches to Guruji and asks , " If everyone is looking to realize the showman to achieve the state of bliss, Who will do the work Guruji and keep the world running ? "

[[***And then Rishi/Guru responds in this way***]{.underline}:]{style="color: #6aa84f;"} { [*This answer will be answered through conversations in next three blogs; This is second one - conversation continued from  [previous one](https://arunkoundinya.github.io/CanvassAndAnalyze/posts/IndianCultureLearning112/)*]{style="font-size: small;"} }

" What is the need to complicate life ? "

Shishya quickly responds, " It is is the race on survival and living "

" What is needed for survival ? "

" To meet the basic needs like food, clothing and shelter "

" What is needed for living ? " asks guruji again.

Confused Shishya says , " I think it is the same "

Guruji smiles and says , " Is Bliss is not needed for Living ? " and points the book of Taittraya Upanishad.

" Of course, every one wants Bliss " says Shishya and continues, " but how can people experience bliss when their life is intertwined for meeting their living needs "

" Most of us work for the comforts for our outer body, senses and for its maintenance; And then we work for our immediate responsibilities and for near future to achieve financial freedom "

" Thus, we are in this continuous game for ever in our life. Every generation does the same but the grammar and the terminology changes "

" Yes Guruji. It is also true that our body has certain responsibilities as we grow in our life. Isn't possible for us, that when we are in our race to fulfil our responsibilities can't we be in a state of bliss " asked Shishya with intensity in a slow and milder tone.

" Are you mentioning about responsibilities or Obligations ? "

" I think they are the same; If we are obliged, we gain responsibility "

Guruji Smiles and Says, " Answer lies in your question itself. We live as if we are obliged for our body and to our near family. Due to which most of us don't know how much enough is needed for our survival ; or else don't know the way to meet the enough survival needs " 

" Since we are in a cycle of obligation, we tend to look outside to close the obligations and gain freedom. However, it is a cycle "

Shishya who is still in deep thinking while listening asks, " What if some people move from obligation cycle to responsibility cycle ? "

" Still it would be a cycle. The better from the previous one is that; we at-least feel happy whenever those responsibilities are fulfilled in timely manner and cherish those moments "

" Which is a better cycle Guruji, such that we cherish all the moments we live in "

" You know it. It is the cycle of love. Love your family and yourself. It is neither obligation nor responsibility; but just love. "

" Love leads to attachment which is a hinderance to be in a state of bliss; that you mentioned a while earlier. " mentions shishya with a lot of confusion around his head.

" Obligation and Responsibility is way of looking the life outside. We will always be in a hurry to fulfil those things so as to find time to be in a state of freedom; which is of-course not possible. Similarly, if love is projected outwards we tend to have an attachment for those outward things; which of-course leads to a cycle; in terms of living it is way better than the other two. "

Shishya still has that unrest in his mind as he couldn't find the answer that he is looking for and asks, " Guruji, you mentioned that the love is projected outwards; Is there something called as '*love that is projected inwards*' ? "
