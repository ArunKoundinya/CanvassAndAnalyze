Meera pushed the window open wide, inviting the cool, fresh air to dance into the room.
The scent of earth and rain mingled softly, as if the world outside was breathing gentle life into the quiet space.

Pooja stirred awake after a while, blinking slowly against the soft light.
She sat up, a faint smile touching her lips.
Her heart felt lighter, even if just a little.

“Thank you, Meera, for staying with me,” she whispered, her voice still tender from sleep.

Meera returned her smile, warmth in her eyes.
**“You’re not alone, Pooja. Sometimes, just knowing someone is here makes all the difference.”**

Pooja sighed and looked out the window, watching the rain’s gentle fall.
It was a lullaby to her restless mind.

“I don’t know why I feel so lost,” she admitted, her gaze distant.
“Like I’m carrying a weight I can’t put down.”

Meera’s gaze softened, steady and kind.
“Perhaps because you are,” she said gently, letting the words settle.

Pooja turned back to Meera, her eyes questioning, “Why does it feel like I’m always running in circles?”

Meera considered this, choosing her words with care.
**“Maybe because you’re running away from love, Pooja. Not because you want to, but because you’ve lost trust.”**

Pooja’s says, “How long can I keep running, Meera?”

Meera reached out, taking Pooja’s hand in hers, a gesture of unwavering support.
“Not forever, Pooja. Not forever.”

In the quiet room, an unspoken understanding passed between them.
It was a moment of raw emotion, a shared truth that needed no further words.

Swati, having spent the whole night talking with Raj, felt the weight of sleep pressing on her eyelids.
She stifled a yawn and decided it was time to head home.
With a few taps, she booked an Uber.

While waiting, she idly scrolled through Instagram.
Her eyes widened when she stumbled upon a viral post, a reel of Pravallika and Sanjay sharing an intimate kiss. But she understood it is AI-Generated.
Surprised, she immediately showed it to Raj.

Raj, trying to appear unaffected despite the turmoil inside him, "How could she do that?"

Swati shook her head. **"Yeah! How can she?"**

Raj hesitated, struggling with his own thoughts. "Maybe, maybe.. she really loves him. Did we mess things up for them?"

Swati blinked, caught off guard. **"What do you mean?"**

Raj shifted uncomfortably. "I mean, since I influenced you. Did we both spoil their relationship?"

Swati gave him a reassuring look. **"Don't overthink it, Raj."**

Just then, her Uber arrived.
Swati got in, waving a quick goodbye to Raj.
As the car pulled away, she dialed Pravallika’s number.

The call connected, and Swati spoke with a firm but caring tone.
**"How long will you keep running after him, Pravallika? Hasn't he broken your trust enough?"**

The conversation hung in the air, a question waiting for its answer.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Pravallika woke up, the lingering effects of the melatonin making her feel a bit foggy.
Even as she brushed her teeth, the AI-generated kiss from the night before replayed in her mind like a loop she couldn't escape.

Her phone buzzed, snapping her back to the present.
It was Swati calling.

Swati's voice was calm but carried a hint of concern.

Pravallika sighed, acknowledging the truth. "Hey Swati! I know you're upset with me."

Swati's response was understanding. "I get it, Pravallika. I really do."

Pravallika sighed, her voice tinged with frustration.

"It's more than that. I feel like I wasn't there for him when he needed me most. What's the difference between his actions and mine?"

Swati's tone was gentle. "Don't overthink it, Pravallika."

Pravallika nodded slowly, her voice tinged with uncertainty. "I just wish things were simpler, you know? Like back when we I first met him."

Swati let out a small, nostalgic laugh. "Those were the days, huh? But life isn't a straight path. It's messy and complicated."

Pravallika took a deep breath, trying to steady her emotions. "Swati, do you ever feel like you are caught in this endless cycle?"

Swati paused, considering the weight of the question. "Sometimes, yes. But maybe that's just part of learning and growing." She paused and continued, "However, we just need to trust the journey."

They shared a moment of silence for a minute.

Pravallika's voice softened, a mix of hope and doubt. **"Does love and trust always have to go hand in hand? Doesn't love deserve a second chance?"**

The question lingered, a reflection of her inner turmoil and the complex web of emotions that bound them all.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sanjay glanced at his phone screen, blinking to clear his vision.
The last message was from Raj.
Surprised, he wondered why Raj would send something like this.

Without hesitation, he dialed Raj's number. "Hey Raj, why would you think I don't trust you?" Sanjay asked, curiosity lacing his voice.

Raj hesitated for a moment before answering. "Because, I feel bad that after you and Swati broke up, I started spending time with her."

Sanjay chuckled softly, trying to ease the tension. "Hey buddy, it's all fine. Really."

They shared a few casual exchanges, starting with light banter about their favorite movies and old college memories.

It was the kind of conversation that flowed effortlessly, reminding them of the easy camaraderie that had always been the cornerstone of their friendship.

"Remember that road trip we took couple of years ago?" Sanjay chuckled. "You were convinced we were lost, but we ended up finding that amazing little diner."

Raj laughed, the sound genuine and warm. "Yeah, and you insisted on ordering everything on the menu. We barely fit back in the car after that."

They continued to reminisce, the conversation weaving through shared experiences and inside jokes that only they could fully appreciate.

The laughter gradually faded, giving way to a comfortable silence.

It was the kind of pause that didn't need filling, a moment of shared understanding and unspoken support.

Sanjay's tone turned reflective as he broke the silence. "You know, Raj, I've been thinking that I always believed love was about loving one person. But I realized, I never truly loved anyone."

Raj was taken aback. **"What? Are you serious?"**

Sanjay nodded, a sense of clarity in his voice. **"Yes, actually. No one broke my heart. It's just that I never loved anyone truly."**

Raj paused, absorbing the confession. "Wow, that's soo deep. But, hey, I think Pravallika still has feelings for you. Did you see her latest viral video on Instagram?"

The conversation lingered, holding a mirror to Sanjay's revelations and the tangled emotions still unfolding.
