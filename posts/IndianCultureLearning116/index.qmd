[*Continuing from previous blogs*]{.underline}:

We have observed where the Rishi who gets enlightened through self inquiry with a true inherent desire to meet the Showman; they would like to come forward to share the similar experience to his few selected disciples; and thus 'the Rishi' becomes 'the Guru'.  Who have created a way for each and everyone of us (In terms of Personal God) to get us liberated and realize the Showman within ourselves. And then we learnt that people who embark a travel to meet the showman are termed as 'Brahmacharya'; To get motivated to meet the showman they start to pray the Sun who is more visible and tangible; and then continue their path for the ultimate showman.

Rishis Disciple is now in a confusion mode asking about the inner light dualities among the people and again got into confusion when he envisaged that his realization to showman has to be Sacrificed to realize him. His question of "*why pooja*" made him to realize that it should not be a ritual but a method to concentrate to realize the god. Whatever work we do, if we perform as per direction of showman we will attain peace and not thinking about the reward for the work.

We left the previous blog with this question.

 Shishya thinks deeply for a while and questions Guruji as , " I Understand Guruji, but if we are not led by our thoughts would it not be leading to our ignorance. Which you usually refer to as Tamasa Guna? " 

[[***And then Rishi/Guru responds in this way***]{.underline}::]{style="color: #6aa84f;"}

" Where does your thoughts originate from shishya ? "

" Inside my brain " replied shishya effortlessly.

" What is there inside your brain that ushered to those thoughts? "

Shishya with an ambiguous face answered, " It is a cryptic one for me Guruji "

" Let me do my best to unravel this mystery for you. Ideally, brain is considered to be a storage of information, and thoughts germinate from this information." replied Guruji with a placid smile on his face.

" Even if the incremental information is miniscule, why do we have different thoughts at different times ? " asked shishya with a defiant body language.

Guruji smiled and replied, " Thoughts originate under the external influence with the aid of our senses "

Shishya's mood got chilled as if a bucket of cold water was poured from top of this head, " What happens next ? "

" Depending upon the external stimuli on our senses, our thoughts may either respond/react positively, negatively or passionately. From these thoughts our actions/buddhi arise which we discussed in our [Gunas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guṇa) class. ", Guruji responded with ease to what shishya supposed to an arcane one.

Shishya with a burdened mind asked, " Since, we will be under constant influence on external environment, isn't it would be difficult for us to come out of the vicious loop of these Gunas. "

" Methods that we have learnt so far acts as a preliminary step to repudiate this vicious loop. i.e.; to have very less to negligible influence of our memory of the past with respect to our present "

Shishya reacted with instant enlightenment, " I'm able to connect the pieces Guruji. If we only raise above to these three Gunas only then we will be guided by our showman. " and reminded this poem.

[*“When one rises above the three gunas that originate in the body;*]{style="background-color: #2b00fe; color: #fcff01;"}

[*one is freed from birth, old age, disease, and death; and attains enlightenment” (Bhagavad Gita 14.20)*]{style="background-color: #2b00fe; color: #fcff01;"}

Guruji started to move to the dining area and on the way he said, " Ignorance/Inertia is a choice made by ourselves based on external stimuli. Most of our life we are ignorant of many lives around us and we are wielded in darkness "

After an hour...

Whilst in midst of his nap shishya woke up suddenly and ran to his master and asked, " What happens in the due course if our actions hurt others ? "
